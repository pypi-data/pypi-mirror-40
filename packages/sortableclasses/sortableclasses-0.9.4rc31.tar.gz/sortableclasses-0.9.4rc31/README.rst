Makes classes sortable by precedence and priority. The order of precedence
of classes and their priority is defined per class and at runtime.

Use case
========

*sortableclasses* makes classes sortable by precedence and priority. This is
useful if you want to take some input, apply a set of transformations, and
output the result (i.e., if you're writing what on UNIX-ish systems is called
a 'filter'). Ordinarily, you would chain those transformations as function
calls (i.e., ``return transform_1(...(transform_n(input)))``), but the larger
the number of transformation grows, the more difficult this is to maintain.

*sortableclasses* enables you to define each of those transformations as a
class, assign each of them a list of predecessor and successor classes or a
numerical priority, and then simply sort them using ``sort`` or ``sorted``.
Simply put, it enables you to write classes that are similar to plugins
in how they function.

For example::

    >>> import sortableclasses
    >>> import abc
    >>> import functools
    >>>
    >>> class Transform(sortableclasses.Pluggable):
    ...     @staticmethod
    ...     @abc.abstractmethod
    ...     def transform(input):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> class MakeContent(Transform):
    ...     @staticmethod
    ...     def transform(input):
    ...         if input == ':-(':
    ...             return ':-|'
    ...         return input
    ...
    >>> class MakeHappy(Transform):
    ...     successorof = (MakeContent,)
    ...     @staticmethod
    ...     def transform(input):
    ...         if input == ':-|':
    ...             return ':-)'
    ...         return input
    ...
    >>> class MakeVeryHappy(Transform):
    ...     successorof = (MakeHappy,)
    ...     @staticmethod
    ...     def transform(input):
    ...         if input == ':-)':
    ...             return ':-D'
    ...         return input
    ...
    >>> transforms = sorted(Transform.getderived())
    >>> transforms
    [<class 'MakeContent'>, <class 'MakeHappy'>, <class 'MakeVeryHappy'>]
    >>> input = ':-('
    >>> functools.reduce(lambda k, s: s.transform(k), transforms, input)
    ':-D'


Installation
============

You use *sortableclasses* **at your own risk.**
You have been warned.

*sortableclasses* requires Python 3.

If you have Python's `setuptools <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/>`_,
simply say::

    pip3 install sortableclasses

Otherwise, download the most recent stable release (`v0.9.4rc31
<https://github.com/odkr/sortableclasses.py/archive/v0.9.4rc31.tar.gz>`_),
unzip it and copy the directory `sortableclasses` into a directory in
your Python's `sys.path`.

You can do all of the above by::

    # Download and unpack *sortableclasses* to the current directory.
    curl -fsS https://codeload.github.com/odkr/sortableclasses.py/tar.gz/v0.9.4rc31 | 
        tar -xz
    # The command below guesses a directory to install *sortableclasses* to.
    PYPATH=$(python3 -c 'import sys; print("\n".join(sys.path))' | 
        grep -v '.zip' | grep -E "(${HOME?}|/local/)" | head -n1)
    # If the command below errors, no suitable directory was found.
    # Otherwise, it will show you where *sortableclasses* will be installed to.
    echo "${PYPATH:?'Did not find a suitable directory.'}" >&2
    # Copy the directory "sortableclasses" into that directory.
    [ -d "${PYPATH:?}" ] && {
        PACKAGE=sortableclasses.py-0.9.4rc31/sortableclasses
        cp -r "$PACKAGE" "$PYPATH" || sudo cp -r "$PACKAGE" "$PYPATH"    
    }
    # Remove the downloaded files, if you want to.
    rm -rf sortableclasses.py-0.9.4rc31
