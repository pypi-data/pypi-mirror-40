Installation
------------

The package is available on PyPI::

    pip install sqlalchemy-redshift

Usage
-----
The DSN format is similar to that of regular Postgres::

    >>> import sqlalchemy as sa
    >>> sa.create_engine('redshift+psycopg2://username@host.amazonaws.com:5439/database')
    Engine(redshift+psycopg2://username@host.amazonaws.com:5439/database)

See the `RedshiftDDLCompiler documentation
<https://sqlalchemy-redshift.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ddl-compiler.html>`_
for details on Redshift-specific features the dialect supports.

Releasing
---------

To perform a release, you will need to be an admin for the project on
GitHub and on PyPI. Contact the maintainers if you need that access.

You will need to have a `~/.pypirc` with your PyPI credentials and
also the following settings::

    [zest.releaser]
    create-wheels = yes

To perform a release, run the following::

    python3.6 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/dist
