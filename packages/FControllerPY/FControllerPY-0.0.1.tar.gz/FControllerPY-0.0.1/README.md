# FControllerPY

Port of [FController for PHP](https://github.com/othercodes/fcontroller)

FController is a container for controllers/modules. This package allow us to register several controllers/modules that can be
called in a simply way from a common entry point. In the same way we can register multiple libraries or services. These services 
or libraries will be available in all modules.
