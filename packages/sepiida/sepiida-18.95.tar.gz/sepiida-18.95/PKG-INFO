        =======
        
        An API framework for common tasks/behavior for a micro-service architecture.   Built on top of Flask, SQLAlchmeny, and Celery.

         - handling errors
         - REST methods
         - permissions (between microservices)
         - creating and managing sessions
         - ... and more.

        Feature : Enviroment Loading
        =======
        Seipiida contains environment loading tools, to load environment variables. A default value needs to be 
        set or created, and can be overridden by a environment variable, or by an exact-match to a docker secret.
        
        
        Feature: API Shaping
        ========
        This tool contains a system for verifying incoming and outgoing  data matches a programmed API Signature, to verify basic data
        conversion and type checking before reaching the inner post, put, get, list behavior.
        
        
        Feature: Filters
        ========
        API's built in sepiida can take and process a standard set of URL filters to make it eaiser to shape and fliter data
        
        Filters Examples:
        	* page[offset]=NUMBER: Set how far into known data to paginate reults when there are many results
        	* page[limit]=NUMBER: Set the count of how many responsees to return when paginating when there are many results
        	* search[propertyy]=value : Searches 'property' of the specified endpoint for a matching value or partial value
