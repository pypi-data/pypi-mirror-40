# General Information:

ngfp aka new gfpoken aka gfpoken-in-python, is a Python 3 adaptation of the gfpoken program using pyglet and GTK3.  ngfp is a puzzle game where you place mirrors to interact with marbles rolling through a grid.  The complexity and size of the game can be adjusted.  Some games may have more than one solution but they will all count as winning games.  Have fun!
