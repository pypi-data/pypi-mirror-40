        CHANGES
        =======
        
        1.1.3 (2019-01-03)
        ------------------
        
        - changed inconsistent line endings in javascript files
        
        - improve prevent event bubble
        
        
        1.1.2 (2018-03-02)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: remove broken code left over in simply.py. SimpleScroller was
          broken at all in this release.
        
        
        1.1.1 (2017-12-27)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: set allwaysUseScrollbar to 0. This will force to show the scrollbar
          only if scroling is needed.
        
        - feature: support j01ScrollerContentViewName attribute in SimpleScroller.
          This allows to simply set a default view name for scrolling content. By
          default index.html is used which was hardcoded in javascript.
        
        
        1.1.0 (2017-09-18)
        ------------------
        
        - changes: moved SimpleScroller from simply.py to custom.py and renamed to
          MCustomScrollbar. The SimpleScroller located  in simply.py is still there but
          the implmentation provides more features like live search support and
          reloading content via jsonrpc. The new SimplyScroller requires the
          j01.simplscroller.js javascript.
        
        
        1.0.1 (2017-01-11)
        ------------------
        
        - updated mCustomScrollbar javascript to version: 3.1.5
        
        - bugfix: added missing mCSB_buttons.png sprite image. Added zrt-replace
          directive for mCSB_buttons.png pointing to an resource folder called img e.g.
          ${context/++resource++img}/mCSB_buttons.png. If this doesn't fit for you,
          simply use the original css resource and apply wherever you need for lookup
          the sprite image.
        
        
        1.0.0 (2015-03-17)
        ------------------
        
        - support new j01.jsonrpc j01.proxy.js implementation
        
        - make scroller work with element as context and use the element as scroll
          container. Support scroller data loading based on javascript libraries.
        
        - implemented support for nanoscroller
        
        - implemented support for m custom scroller (recommended)
