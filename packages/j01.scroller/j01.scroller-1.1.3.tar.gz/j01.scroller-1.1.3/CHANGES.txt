  only if scroling is needed.

- feature: support j01ScrollerContentViewName attribute in SimpleScroller.
  This allows to simply set a default view name for scrolling content. By
  default index.html is used which was hardcoded in javascript.

------------------

- changes: moved SimpleScroller from simply.py to custom.py and renamed to
  MCustomScrollbar. The SimpleScroller located  in simply.py is still there but
  the implmentation provides more features like live search support and
  reloading content via jsonrpc. The new SimplyScroller requires the
  j01.simplscroller.js javascript.

------------------

- updated mCustomScrollbar javascript to version: 3.1.5

  directive for mCSB_buttons.png pointing to an resource folder called img e.g.
  ${context/++resource++img}/mCSB_buttons.png. If this doesn't fit for you,
  simply use the original css resource and apply wherever you need for lookup
  the sprite image.
