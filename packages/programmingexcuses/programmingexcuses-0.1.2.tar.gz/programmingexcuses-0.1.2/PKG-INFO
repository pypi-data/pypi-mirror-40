        Testing
        =======
        
        There are no tests! I was gonna make up an excuse for that but this
        package does it for me :D
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ programmingexcuse

        Itâ€™s quite simple:

           import programmingexcuses
           print(programming_excuses.get_excuse())
        
        And, for convenience:
        
        .. code:: python
