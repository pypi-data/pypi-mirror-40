        Python client for KeePassHTTP to interact with KeePass's credentials.
        
        
        ## Install
        
            pip install keepasshttp
            
        
        ## Usage
        
            import keepasshttp
            
            # get single credential
            credential = keepasshttp.get("my_credential_name_or_url")
            print(credential.login)
            print(credential.password)
            
            # find all credentials's name
            credentials = keepasshttp.list()
            
            # fetch all partiall matching credentials
            credentials = keepasshttp.search("my_credential_name_or_url")
            
            # create a new keepasshttp entry
            keepasshttp.create("login", "password", "url")
            
            # update a keepasshttp entry
            keepasshttp.update("login", "password", "url", "uuid")
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
        This module will write to `~/.python_keepass_http` to save allowed AES key.
        To change this path, instanciate `KeePassHTTP` with a different file.
        
            from keepasshttp import KeePassHTTP
            kph = KeePassHTTP('./keepass_key')
            
            
        ## Testing
        
        You can simply run the tests using:
        
            python -m unittest discover
            
        `KeePassHTTP` calls are mocked, to run the tests against a real server, you need to:
         
           - open `tests/test_database.kdbx` in `KeePass` password is `test`
           - set `TEST_WITH_KEEPASS` environment variable
           - run test normally
        
        
        ## Coverage
        
        To run tests with coverage:
        
            pip install pytest-cov
            pytest --cov
