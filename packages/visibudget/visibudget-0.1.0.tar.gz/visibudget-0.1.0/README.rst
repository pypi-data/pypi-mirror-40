VisiBudget helps you "see" your budget working over time.

VisiBudget is a new kind of budget management system. It isn't concerned with double-entry accounting (though it does
this behind the scenes), nor does it try to do everything for you. Instead, VisiBudget helps you to visualize the effect
of spending your money on your paycheck so you always know how much money you have and what it can be used for.

If you have ever used another budget management system, you've probably seen that they either get very complicated very
quickly, trying to make everything "easy" for you, or they leave all the hard work up to you. VisiBudget only tries to
help you keep track of the money coming in, what account it goes into, where it goes out later and when, and how much
you have spent and have left over. Your spending is mapped out on a calendar so you can easily see how much you will
have on a given date and how far you've progressed towards your savings goals.

Installation
------------

To install VisiBudget, simply use `pipenv <http://pipenv.org/>`_ (or pip, of course):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pipenv install visibudget

The skeleton for this project borrows heavily from work already done by
`Kenneth Reitz`_. I would have had a much tougher time putting this
together if he hadn't already done a lot of it already. If you `thank me`_
for this project, please also `thank Kenneth`_ as well!
