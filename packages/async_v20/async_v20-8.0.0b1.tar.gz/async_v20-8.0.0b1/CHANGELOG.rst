Changelog
=========

8.0.0b0 (01/01/2019)
====================

- Added guaranteedStopLossOrderRestriction to Instrument definition

7.0.1b0
=======
- OandaClient.close is now a coroutine

7.0.0b0
=======

- All OrderRequests now require an `instrument` as there first parameter.
  This is to allow correct rounding of decimal numbers to the instruments specification.
- `guaranteed: bool` has been added to Transaction definition.
- Default SinceTransactionID value is now limited to the passed 900 transactions.
- `OandaClient.account()` method will use `get_account_details()` method when default
  `SinceTransactionID` has expired.
- `OandaClient.get_pricing` now accepts an `InstrumentName` for `instruments`


6.2.2b0
=======

- `guaranteed: bool` has been added to Order definition.

6.2.1b0
=======

- Array class lazy instantiates objects
- Model objects with same attributes now compare equal (proving equal DateTime format)
- Improved repr of Array objects
- Improved implementation of `get_instrument`/s, `get_id`
- All Array objects have `get_instrument` and `get_instruments`. Returns either the first or all matching objects
- Removed Model class `_template` attribute as it was obsolete
- Added `get(self, name, default=None)` method to Model to allow for dict like key access.

6.2.0b0
=======

- Changed `get_transactions` method to `get_transaction` (API call can only return one transaction)
- Removed default parameter argument for `get_transaction`.(**transaction_id**) it is a required parameter.
- Made OandaClient.hosts a protected member. Now OandaClient._hosts
- `Array`. **get_instruments()** returns an Array of the same type this is when there is a one to many relationship
  between the instrument and objects the array contains. `Array`. **get_instrument()** Returns the single object
  when there is a one to one relationship. Both methods are mutually exclusive
- All objects now lazy instantiate attribute instances.
- Large refactoring of async_v20.definitions.base

6.1.0b0
=======

- Changed incorrect naming _i_ds to _ids
- Fixed OrderRequest formatting when a OrderRequest instance is passed that defines an instrument.

6.0.2b0
=======

- Fixed InvalidFormatRequest Error when OrderRequest does not define an `instrument` attribute

6.0.1b0
=======

- Fixed incorrect handling of stream response when endpoint returned status 400

6.0.0b0
=======

- Added health API and initialization check
- Fixed stream_transactions. Now returns correct type
- Changed streaming responses keys. Where stream_pricing() returned 'PRICE' or 'HEARTBEAT'
  response now contains 'price' or 'heartbeat'. Like wise stream_transactions() now returns
  'transaction' or 'heartbeat'. This has been done to standardise access to the transaction
  stream response and 'heartbeat' objects. Due to the different types these objects may take.
- Added async_v20.exceptions module
- Added logging to modules

5.0.3b0
=======

- Added default argument to Array.get_id & Array.get_instrument

5.0.2b0
=======

- Fixed bug in rest implementation. Positions now update correctly

5.0.1b0
=======

- OandaClient.datetime_format is read only
- OandaClient._instruments is no longer a protected attribute. It is now OandaClient.instruments

5.0.0b0
=======

- DateTime's create pandas.Timestamp's
- Model.dict argument `datetime` is now `datetime_format`. Argument behaviour now
  specifies the representation of times. Either `RFC3339` or `UNIX`. Corresponding `json` argument
  changes the representation of UNIX times to either a `str` or `numpy.int64`
- *Response* .json() accepts `datetime_format` argument string

4.0.0b0
=======

- Changed get_positions to get_position (as method can only close one position)
- _in_context accepts negative units


3.0.0b0
=======

  representations
- Added documentation for order API methods
