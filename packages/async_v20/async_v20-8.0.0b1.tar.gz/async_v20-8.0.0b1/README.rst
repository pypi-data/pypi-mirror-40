Documentation
-------------

http://async-v20.readthedocs.io/

Disclaimer
----------

- Losses can exceed investment.
- async_v20 and its creator has no affiliation with OANDA. And is not endorsed by OANDA in any manner.
- async_v20 is in Beta stage and has not been tested on a live OANDA account
- **Use at own risk**

Features
---------

- Exposes the entire v20 API
- No `*args, **kwargs` In client methods. Therefore no need to guess what arguments a method takes
- Serialize objects directly into *pandas* **Series** or **DataFrame** objects
- Construct *concurrent* trading algorithms



installation
------------

**REQUIRES:**

python >= 3.6

https://www.python.org/

    $ pip install async_v20


`async_v20` is built with `aiohttp <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp>`_.
It is therefore recommended to also install `cchardet` and `aiodns` as per `aiohttp`
`documentation <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install cchardet

   $ pip install aiodns

Why async_v20?
--------------

There are many OANDA clients for python already available so why create another?
The main driver for creating async_v20 was to facilitate better risk management,
by allowing user's to concurrently monitor account status and trade currency's.

An unintended consequence of async_v20 is the ability to create clear segregation
between implementation ideas.

A simple example might contain a coroutine for the following:

    - Monitoring overall account status
    - Watching price stream and triggering buy/sell signals
    - Monitoring individual trades and closing movements against held positions

A synchronous implementation would require considerable effort to determine which
task communicates with the server next. async_v20 removes this burden by using
`aiohttp <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp>`_

Further goals of async_v20 has been to lower the barrier of entry for algorithmic trading
by providing a complete and simple to use interface.


Getting started
===============


Creating an Account
-------------------

To use `async_v20` you must have an account with *OANDA*

- Create an account

    https://www.oanda.com/account/login
- Create an API *token*

    https://www.oanda.com/demo-account/tpa/personal_token

Setting up environment
----------------------

- Install `async_v20` as per **installation**
- Create a new *environment variable* with the name 'OANDA_TOKEN' and value as the *token* generated from above


**Note:**

- It is considered best practice use a *virtual environment*
- It is not required to store the token in an *environment variable*. The token can be passed to OandaClient

Using async_v20
---------------

Once an account has been created as per *create-account*
and the environment is configured as per *setting-up-environment*
we are ready to begin.

Lets first take a look at this code example, then go though it line by line.


.. code-block:: python

   import asyncio

   from async_v20 import OandaClient


   async def get_account():
       async with OandaClient() as client:
           return await client.account()


   loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
   account = loop.run_until_complete(get_account())

   # pandas Series
   print(account.series())

   # HTTP response state
   print(account)

   # JSON data in python dictionary format
   print(account.dict())


First we need to import *asyncio* this allows us to run our *coroutine*

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio


We then import *OandaClient* which provides us the means to interact with OANDA

.. code-block:: python

    from async_v20 import OandaClient


Because *OandaClient* returns *coroutines* we use *async def*. This allows the use of the *await* syntax

.. code-block:: python

    async def get_account():


*OandaClient* is a *context manager*, we use *async with* to instantiate a
client instance. Doing so will automatically close the *http session* when we're done

.. code-block:: python

        async with OandaClient() as client:


We then create and *run* the *coroutine* by calling *client*. **account()**

.. code-block:: python

            return await client.account()


Now we have defined our *coroutine* we need to execute it.
To do so we need an event loop. Achieved using *asyncio*. **get_event_loop()**

.. code-block:: python

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()


The value returned by executing the `account()` *coroutine* is accessed through the event loop.

.. code-block:: python

    account = loop.run_until_complete(get_account())


`async_v20` objects have a **series()** method that returns a `pandas`. **Series**.
By default `async_v20`. **DateTime**'s will be converted into `pandas`. **Timestamp**'s.

.. code-block:: python

    print(account.series())


**Outputs**

.. code-block:: python
