# detox is unmaintained and incompatible with tox > 3.6

`detox` was a plugin for [`tox`](https://pypi.org/project/tox/) to enable parallel environment execution. `tox` 3.7 added a native possibility to do this (`tox -p|--parallel`) and effectively supercedes detox.

# What is detox?

detox is the distributed version of [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/).  It makes efficient use of multiple CPUs by running all possible activities in parallel.  It has the same options and configuration that tox has so after installation can just run:

    detox

in the same way and with the same options with which you would run `tox`, see the [tox home page](http://tox.readthedocs.io) for more info.

Additionally, detox offers a `-n` or `--num` option to set the number of concurrent processes to use.

**NOTE** due to the concurrent execution of the testenvs the output of the different testruns is not printed to the terminal. Instead they are logged into separate files inside the `log` directories of the testenvs.
