        # pycmx
        
        The `pycmx` package provides a basic interface for parsing a CMX 3600 EDL and its most most common variations.
        
        ## Features
        
        * The major variations of the CMX3600, the standard, "File32" and "File128" 
          formats are automatically detected and properly read.
        * Remark or comment fields with common recognized forms are read and 
          available to the client, including clip name and source file data.
        * Symbolically decodes transitions
        * Does not parse or validate timecodes, does not enforce framerates, does not
          parameterize timecode or framerates in any way. This makes the parser more
          tolerant of EDLs with mixed rates.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        
        ```
        
        ## Should I Use This?
        
        At this time, this is (at best) alpha software and the interface will be 
        changing often. It may be fun to experiment with but it is not suitable
        at this time for production code.
        
        Contributions are welcome and will make this module production-ready all the
        faster! Please reach out or file a ticket!
