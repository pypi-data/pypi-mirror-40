        ===============================
        
        ``rmux`` allows you to run your local project on multiple remote machines in
        parallel.
        
        The command names comes from remote-tmux as it allows to multiplex commands
        on multiple remote machienes, syncronized.
        
        The original purpose was to allow testing local changes to a project on other
        platforms, like running tox on another distribution.
        
        To use it you need to define the list of remote hosts like:
        ```
        export HOSTS="node1 node2"
        ```
        If you fail to define the ``HOSTS`` variable the tool will default to localhost
        but it will still use its logic of doing a rsync and running commands using
        tmux and ssh.
