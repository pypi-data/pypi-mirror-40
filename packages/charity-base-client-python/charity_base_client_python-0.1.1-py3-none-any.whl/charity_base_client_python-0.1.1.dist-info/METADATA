Description: # CharityBase Client Library (Python)
        
        A Python client library for interacting with the CharityBase REST API. Tested on python 3.7.1
        
        Modelled on the [official charitybase JavaScript client](https://github.com/charity-base/charity-base-client-js).
        
        ## Authorisation
        
        Log in to the [CharityBase API Portal](https://charitybase.uk/api-portal) and create an API key.
        
        ## Example
        
        Search for "homeless" charities with income range Â£100k - Â£1m, sorted by descending income:
        
        ```python
        from charitybase import CharityBase
        
        
        charityBase = CharityBase(apiKey='my-api-key')
        
        res = charityBase.charity.list({
          'fields': ['income.latest.total'],
          'search': 'homeless',
          'incomeRange': [100000, 1000000],
          'sort': 'income.latest.total:desc',
          'limit': 10,
          'skip': 0,
        })
        print(res.charities)
        ```
        
        (Remember to replace `my-api-key` with your actual key, copied from the [CharityBase API Portal](https://charitybase.uk/api-portal))
