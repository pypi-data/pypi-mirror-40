*** What is Slune???

Slune is a 3D game! It includes racing, car-crashing, and lots of
action!

Slune has been made for personal RESEARCH. The goals were to reply to
the questions:

 * Is it possible to realize a 3D game with "correct" graphism fully
 in a script language (like Python) ?

 * Is it possible to realize a game that, without being an educative
   game in the common sens of it, is a "civic / documentary game" that
   can spread a message, more intelligent than the ones of most of
   commercial games.

The answer to both questions is "yes" ;-)



*** Help needed !

We espescially search for graphists and translators.

We also search people for porting Slune to other OS, and for
maintaining the windows version.



*** How to translate Slune ?

 * cd Slune-with-deps-XXX/slune # go into the Slune directory

 * ./localeextract $TRANSLATE_TO $TRANSLATE_FROM

where $TRANSLATE_TO is the language you want to translate to (e.g. nb)
and $TRANSLATE_FROM the language you want to translate from (defaults
to en and then fr).
The script will output some GNU GetText code. Add this code to file:

./locale/$TRANSLATE_TO/LC_MESSAGES/slune.po

(create the file if it does not exist yet).
Then, in this code, translate all text following "msgstr". Don't touch
"msgid"!



*** Requirement

 * Python 2.2.x (the latest is the best; tested on 2.3.4)
   INCLUDING the files for compiling python modules in C,
   e.g. , on Linux Mandrake, you need to install the package :
   'libpython2.3-devel-2.3.3-2mdk' (version numbers may change)

 * Linux (any architecture; other OS may be supported but have not
   been tested at all)

 * OpenGL (tested with Radeon DRI and NVidia dirvers; hardware
   acceleration is heavily advised, though not strictly required)

 * GLEW (http://sourceforge.net/projects/glew)

 * SDL (http://libsdl.org/)

 * OpenAL (www.openal.org), PyOgg and PyVorbis (www.xiph.org) for
   sound support.

 * Cal3D (cal3d.sourceforge.net)
   
The Slune tarball comes with all other dependencies (including Soya3D).



*** Installation

tar -xvzf Slune-XXX.tar.gz
cd Slune-XXX

 * Do:

python ./setup.py build

 * Do AS ROOT:

su
python ./setup.py install

You may get the following warning:

  warning: install: modules installed to '/usr/share/',
  which is not in Python's module search path (sys.path)
  -- you'll have to change the search path yourself

You can safely ignore the warning !

You can play without installing by running ./run_without_install;
you STILL need to do the build step !!!



*** How to launch Slune?

Just type "slune" on a console !

There's also a command line interface, see "slune --help" for more
information.



*** How to play?

Mouse position / cursor key : left / right to turn; top to go faster;
down to go slower

Left   click / Ctrl : long jump
Middle click / Shift: high jump
Right  click / Alt  : nitro

When jumping: Roll up-down / Ctrl-shift: look up / down (for
looping,...)

q, escape: quit



*** Known bugs

 * Sound problems : OpenAL may not support your sound card (e.g.
   sound quality is poor, and you get some error printed on the
   console, about "native_blitbuffer: Assertion `0' failed" or "fcntl:
   Invalid argument"). Some people has obtained good result by forcing
   the use of esd. For that, edit ~/.openalrc, and write in it :
   
     (define devices '(esd))

 * ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot handle TLS data
   This problem occurs typically on Debian with NVidia cards.
   Just install the "nvidia-glx" Debian package.
