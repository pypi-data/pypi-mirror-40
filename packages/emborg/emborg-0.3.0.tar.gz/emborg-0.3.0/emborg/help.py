            Emborg is a simple command line utility to orchestrate backups. It
            is built on Bort, which is a powerful and fast de-duplicating backup utility for
            managing encrypted backups, however it can be rather clumsy to use directly.
            With emborg, you specify all the details about your
            backups once in advance, and then use a very simple command line
            interface for your day-to-day activities.

            You should assure you have a backup copy of the encryption
            passphrase in a safe place.  This is very important. If the only
            copy of the passphrase is on the disk being backed up and that disk
            were to fail you would not be able to access your backups.

            If you keep the passphrase in a settings file, you should set
            its permissions so that it is not readable by others:

                chmod 700 ~/.config/emborg/settings

            Better yet is to simply not store the passphrase.  This can be
            arranged if you are using Avendesora
            (https://github.com/KenKundert/avendesora), which is a flexible
            password management system. The interface to Avendesora is already
            built in to emborg, but its use is optional (it need not be
            installed).

            It is also best, if it can be arranged, to keep your backups at a
            remote site so that your backups do not get destroyed in the same
            disaster, such as a fire or flood, that claims your original files.
