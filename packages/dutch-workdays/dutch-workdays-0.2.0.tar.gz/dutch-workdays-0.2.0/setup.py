It not only includes Python code to handle calendars from most of the world, but it also requires C libraries to calculate high-precision astronomy computations. It\'s an overkill if you only need to know about Dutch holidays.\n\nDiffences from Workalendar\n--------------------------\n\n- All the codebase is type annotated.\n- Zero dependencies\n- Dateutil easter calculation is vendorized.\n    \n.. _workalendar: https://github.com/peopledoc/workalendar\n.. _workdays documentation: https://peopledoc.github.io/workalendar/\n',
