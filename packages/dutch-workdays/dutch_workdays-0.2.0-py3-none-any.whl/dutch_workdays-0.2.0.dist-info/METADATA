Dutch Workdays
==============

A very small library that handles with Dutch calendars and holidays ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

Installing
----------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dutch-workdays

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from dutch_workdays import Calendar
    >>> cal = Calendar()
    >>> cal.get_king_queen_day(2018)
    (datetime.date(2018, 4, 27), "King's day")


``dutch-workdays`` works as a drop-in replacement of workalendar_, so for the rest of the API please refer to
the `workdays documentation`_.

Why not just using Workalendar instead?
---------------------------------------

Workalendar is an awesome library, it's very complete and very well maintained but it's, unfortunately, quite a big dependency as well. It not only includes Python code to handle calendars from most of the world, but it also requires C libraries to calculate high-precision astronomy computations. It's an overkill if you only need to know about Dutch holidays.

Diffences from Workalendar
--------------------------

- All the codebase is type annotated.
- Zero dependencies
- Dateutil easter calculation is vendorized.
