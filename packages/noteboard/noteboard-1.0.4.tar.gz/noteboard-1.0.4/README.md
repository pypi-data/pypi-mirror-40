```

---

### View Boards

`board`

* `-st/--show-time` : show boards with the last modified time of each items
* `-i/--interactive` : enter [interactive mode](#interactive-mode)

---

### Add Item

`board add <item text>`

* `-b/--board <name>` : add the item to this board

If no `board` is given, the item will be added to the default board (configured in `config.ini`)

---

### Remove Item

`board remove <item id>`

---

### Clear Board

Remove all items in the board.

`board clear`

* `-b/--board <name>` : clear this board only

If no `board` is given, all boards will be cleared.

---

### Tick / Mark / Star Item

`board {tick, mark, star} <item id>`

Run this command again on the same item to untick/unmark/unstar the item

---

### Edit Item

`board edit <item id> <new text>`

---

### Tag Item

`board tag <item id>`

* `-t/--text <tag text>` : tag the item with this text
* `-c/--color <background color>` : set the background color `colorama.Back` of this tag (default: BLUE)

If no `text` is given, existing tag of this item will be removed.

---

### Run Item as Command

`board run <item id>`

This will spawn a subprocess to execute the command.

*NOTE: Some commands may not work properly in subprocess, such as pipes.*

**TODO:** Execute command in a peseudo terminal.

---

### Undo Previous Actions

`board undo`

#### Actions that can be undone:

* add
* remove
* clear
* edit
* import

---

### Import Boards from External JSON File

`board import <path>`

*NOTE:* This will overwrite all the current data of boards.

The JSON file must be in a valid structure simillar to the following.

```json
{
    "Board Title": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "data": "item text",
            "time": "<timestamp>",
            "date": "<human readable date format>",
            "tick": false,
            "mark": false,
            "star": false,
            "tag": "<tag text with ANSI code (auto manipulated by noteboard)>"
        },
    ]
}
```

---

### Export Boards Data as JSON File

`board export`

* `-d/--dest <destination path>` : destination path of the exported file (directory)

The exported JSON file is named `board.json`.

---

## Interactive Mode

Use `board -i/--interactive` to enter interactive mode.

**Commands:**

1. add
2. remove
3. clear
4. edit
5. undo
6. import
7. quit

Enter an empty line to view boards. Enter an empty line in prompt to abort operation.

*NOTE: You can use quotations (`'` or `"`) to specify multiple board titles / board titles that contain spaces and item ids.*

## Cautions

Some terminal emulators may not support dimmed (`Style.DIM`) & underlined (`\033[4m`) text.

The program also uses symbols such as `⭑` and `✔` which also may not be displayed properly in some terminal emulators and Windows cmd.

### Tested On:

**Shells:** bash, zsh

**Terminal Emulators:** iTerm2
