        Optional Arguments:
            -h, --help          show this help message and exit
            -st, --show-time    show boards with the added time of every items
            -i, --interactive   enter interactive mode
        ```
        
        ### View Boards
        
        `board`
        
        * `-st/--show-time` : show boards with the added time of each items
        
        #### Interactive Mode
        
        `board -i/--interactive` : enter interactive mode
        
        This mode allows you to operate with boards more dynamically as you can modify many items at a time.
        
        ### Add Item
        
        `board add <item text>`
        
        * `-b/--board <name>` : add the item to this board
        
        If no `board` is given, the item will be added to the default board (configured in `config.ini`)
        
        ### Remove Item
        
        `board remove <item id>`
        
        ### Clear Board
        
        Remove all items in the board.
        
        `board clear`
        
        * `-b/--board <name>` : clear this board only
        
        If no `board` is given, all boards will be cleared.
        
        ### Tick / Mark / Star Item
        
        `board {tick, mark, star} <item id>`
        
        Run this command again on the same item to untick/unmark/unstar the item
        
        ### Edit Item
        
        `board edit <item id> <new text>`
        
        ### Tag Item
        
        `board tag <item id>`
        
        * `-t/--text <tag text>` : tag the item with this text
        * `-c/--color <background color>` : set the background color `colorama.Back` of this tag (default: BLUE)
        
        If no `text` is given, existing tag of this item will be removed.
        
        ### Run Item as Command
        
        `board run <item id>`
        
        This will spawn a subprocess to execute the command.
        
        *NOTE: Some commands may not work properly in subprocess, such as pipes.*
        
        **TODO:** Execute command in a peseudo terminal.
        
        ### Undo Previous Actions
        
        `board undo`
        
        #### Actions that can be undone:
        
        * add
        * remove
        * clear
        * edit
        * import
        
        ### Import Boards from External JSON File
        
        `board import <path>`
        
        *NOTE:* This will overwrite all the current data of boards.
        
        The JSON file must be in a valid structure simillar to the following.
        
        ```json
        {
            "Board Title": [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "data": "item text",
                    "time": "<timestamp>",
                    "tick": false,
                    "mark": false,
                    "star": false,
                    "tag": "<manipulated tag text with ANSI code>"
                },
            ]
        }
        ```
        
        ### Export Boards Data as JSON File
        
        `board export`
        
        * `-d/--dest <destination path>` : destination path of the exported file (directory)
        
        The exported JSON file is named `board.json`.
        
        ### Reset to Default
        
        `board reset`
        
        * `-c/--config` : reset the configurations to default only
        
        If `config` flag **is not** specified, this will delete all files inside `~/.noteboard` directory.
        
        If `config` flag **is** specified, only `~/.noteboard/config.ini` will be set to default. This will not affect the data.
        
        ## Cautions
        
        Some terminal emulators may not support dimmed (`Style.DIM`) & underlined (`\033[4m`) text.
        
        The program also uses symbols such as `⭑` and `✔` which also may not be displayed properly in some terminal emulators.
        
        ### Tested On:
        
        **Shells:** bash, zsh
        
        **Terminal Emulators:** iTerm2
        
        ## Customizing Configurations
        
        Path to the config file: `~/.noteboard/config.ini`
        
        You can change the foreground color of action texts by editing `~/.noteboard/config.ini` file in the `COLORS` section.
        
        For the available foreground colors, please refer to the [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) module.
        
        ```ini
        [COLORS]
        ; Default colors of each actions.
        ; Values must be valid properties of colorama.Fore
        ; Values must be in upper cases.
        run = LIGHTCYAN_EX
        add = GREEN
        remove = MAGENTA
        clear = RED
        tick = LIGHTYELLOW_EX
        mark = CYAN
        star = YELLOW
        edit = BLUE
        tag = LIGHTBLUE_EX
        import =
        export =
        undo = BLUE
        reset = YELLOW
        ```
