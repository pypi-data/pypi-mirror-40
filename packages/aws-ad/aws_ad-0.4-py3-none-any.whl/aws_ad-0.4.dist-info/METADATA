# aws-ad

This project provides command line tool - aws-ad to simplify process of logging into AWS account with Windows AD credentials

It is inspired by basically identical tool aws-adfs. I wrote it mainly out of curioucity how to do it by myself, and was to lazy to check, why orginal tool 
randomly refused to work under bamboo
