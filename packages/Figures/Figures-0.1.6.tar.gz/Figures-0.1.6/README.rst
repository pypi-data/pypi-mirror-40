Reporting and data retrieval app for `Open edX <https://open.edx.org/>`__.

.. _notice_section:

-----------------------------
Notice and Development Status
-----------------------------


Figures is now avaible on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/figures/>`__ for open beta testing on Open edX Ginkgo!

Currently it runs on Ficus and Ginkgo. We have Hawthorn in the backlog. We welcome community involvement to upgrade to Hawthorn.

If you find bugs or run into issues, please submit an issue ticket to the `Figures issue tracker <https://github.com/appsembler/figures/issues>`__ on Github.


--------
Overview
--------

Figures is a reporting and data retrieval app. It plugs into the edx-platform LMS app server. Its goal is to provide site-wide and cross-course analytics that compliment Open edX's traditional course-centric analytics.

To evolve Figures to meet community needs, we are keeping in mind as principles the following features, which Jill Vogel outlined in her `lightweight analytics <https://edxchange.opencraft.com/t/analytics-lighter-faster-cheaper/202>`__ post on ed Xchange:

* Real time (or near real time) updates
* Lightweight deployment
* Flexible reporting
* Simpler contributions

Please refer to the Figures `design document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/16orj6Ag1R158-J-zSBfiY31RKQ5FuSu1O5F-zpSKOg4/>`__ for more details on goals and architecture.


------------
Requirements
------------

* Python (2.7)
* Django (1.8)
* Open edX (Ficus or Ginkgo)

Installation

Devstack
========

Go `here <docs/source/devstack.rst>`__ for instructions to install and run Figures in devstack.

Production
==========

go `here <docs/source/install.rst>`__ for instructions to install Figures in production.

--------------------
Project Architecture
--------------------

Front-end
=========

The Figures user interface is a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and uses the `create-react-app <https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app>`_ build scaffolding generator.

Back-end
========

The Figures back-end is a reusable Django app. It contains a set of REST API endpoints that serve a dual purpose of providing data to the front-end and to remote clients.


-------
Testing
-------

*TODO: Improve the testing instructions*

The unit tests **should** be able to run on any OS that supports Python 2.7.x

Clone the repo:

::

 	git@github.com:appsembler/figures.git

Go to the project directory:

::

	cd figures

Create a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ for Python 2.7.x.

Install required Python packages:

::

	pip install -r devsite/requirements.txt

From the `figures` repository root directory:

::

	py.test

If all goes well, the Figures unit tests will all complete succesfully

------
Future
------

* Open edX "Hawthorn" will provide a plug-in architecture. This will hopefully simplify Figures installation even more
* Downloadable report files
* Plugin architecture to extend Figures for custom data sources
