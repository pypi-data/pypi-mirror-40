Building a Figures release

The general process is to build the assets in develop branch, then PR to master




clone figures
change branch to develop
install environment package dependencies
* JavaScript
* Python


cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

delete the old files, add new and modified ones. You'll see something like


```

(figures) opus:figures jbaldwin$ git st
On branch release_0_1_5
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   figures/static/figures/asset-manifest.json

	modified:   figures/webpack-stats.json

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	figures/static/figures/static/js/main.0da4d024.js
	figures/static/figures/static/js/main.0da4d024.js.map

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Commit the changes


Create new release version
- bump the version in setup.py
- Add new entry for CHANGELOG.md

# create and test the updated package

Make sure tests pass (The PR should do that)


# Tagging a release

After PR is merged to master, tag the version with an annotated tag, making sure
that you have the version number correct

```
git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "tag message"
git push origin 1.0.1
```

This will bring up an editor to fill in the commit message. Provide details you
would want if you were a member of the Open edX community and needed to understand
what is in the release. See past examples in the [Figures releases page on Github](https://github.com/appsembler/figures/releases/).

Click on one (or more) of the tags to see the commit messages

In general, you want to document what was changed at a high level

Structure of the message
First line the version
Followed by bullets highlighting the new behavior or if just one line, no bullet

# Release

## Build the PyPI package

```
make clean_python_buld
make build_python
```

# Load Twine credentials

```
export TWINE_USERNAME="your-pypi-username"
export TWINE_PASSWORD="your-pypi-password"
```

# Run twine

First check the Python distributions:
```
make twine_check
```

If passes, push to PyPI testing (test.pypi.org)

```
twine push test
```

# Test the package

Currently manual testing is needed for the installation and integration validation

You created distribution packages in the Figures `./dist/` folder. Make these files available to the Vagrant VM you are using to test the release.

* Shell into the vm
* Become the edxapp user
* `pip uninstall figures`
* `pip install path/to/Figures-0.1.6.tar.gz`

## Spot testing

* Make sure the React UI works
* Make sure the API works
* Run the pipeline Django management command

## Deeper testing

_This is a wish list_

* Rich data
* Automate API testing 
* Security inspection
* Pipeline diagnostics



# Testing in devstack

In an Open edX devstack

* Uninstall Figures if already installed
* pip install Figures. This should pull from PyPI. Make sure the version is the
  latest you pushed to PyPI



commit changes
push to pr from develop to master
