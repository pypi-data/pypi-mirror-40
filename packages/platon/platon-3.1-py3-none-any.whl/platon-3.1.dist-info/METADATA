# PLanetary Atmospheric Transmission for Observer Noobs (PLATON)

**November 29, 2018: PLATON v3.0 is out!  Please check the release notes on GitHub for the list of new features.  Our paper actually describes v2.1, but v3 has a substantial number of improvements, and we strongly recommend everyone use it.**

**NEW (October 1): Version 2 is out, with a huge number of changes! Make sure to\
 check out the release notes, and upgrade.**

PLATON is a fast and easy to use forward modelling and retrieval tool for
exoplanet atmospheres. It was written by Michael Zhang and Yayaati Chachan, and
is based on ExoTransmit by Eliza Kempton.

We welcome any feedback. Please send any comments, suggestions, or bug reports
to Michael Zhang: zmzhang "at" caltech.edu
