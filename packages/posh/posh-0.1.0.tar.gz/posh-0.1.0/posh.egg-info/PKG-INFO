        Add methods for inserting to DB for long-term analysis, product price monitoring, build out purchase/watch methods, lots more :-)
        
        "Why isn't X a feature"
        -------
        Because I haven't thought of it, but I'd appreciate the suggestion!
        
        
        Credits
        -------
        
        This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.
        
        .. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter
        .. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
        
        Development Goals
        -------
        
        As of now, my goal for this project is just to extend it out as much as makes sense by thinking of new ideas, methods, and functions that'd be useful or interesting.  Ideally, down the road this module could answer questions like "What was the average selling price of a new-with-tag Vera Wang dress over the last 6 months," which could inform you to buy one because it's relatively cheap or sell one because it's relatively expensive now compared to the average.  So, I don't really have definitive guidelines of where this will go.  That's the fun part!
