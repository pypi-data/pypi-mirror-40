Description: # Khopesh #
        
        Khopesh is a very simple wrapper around cli tools that allow you to have pre and post hooks for any subcommands.
        
        Hooks are local to a folder, give you the possibility to behave differently in different locations
        
        # Install #
        
            pip install khopesh
        
        # How it works #
        
        - Create a hooks folder
        - Inside the hooks folder, create a folder with the name of the executable you want to be hooked by khopesh
        - Add an alias in your .bashrc / .zshrc file to replace the command to be hooked by "khopesh thecommand"
