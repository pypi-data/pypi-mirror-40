The ``summit count`` plugin for python-openstackclient helps the user
determine the number of summits they have attended since the beginning
of their interaction with OpenStack.

For example, if your first summit was for the "Folsom" series and the
next summit is for "Rocky"::

  $ openstack summit count folsom rocky

  +---------+-------+

  | PTGs  | 3     |
  +-------+-------+
