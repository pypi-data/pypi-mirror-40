Description: # BlackSheep
        HTTP Server/Client microframework for Python asyncio, using [Cython](https://cython.org), 
        [`uvloop`](https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/), and 
        [`httptools`](https://github.com/MagicStack/httptools).

        ```bash
        pip install blacksheep
        ```
        
        ---
        
        ```python
        from datetime import datetime
        from blacksheep import Response, TextContent
        from blacksheep.server import Application
        
        
        app = Application()
        
        @app.route('/')
        async def home(request):
            return Response(200, content=TextContent(f'Hello, World! {datetime.utcnow().isoformat()}'))
        
        app.start()
        ```
        
        ## Objectives
        * Clean architecture and source code, following SOLID principles
        * Avoid CPU cycles to handle things that are not strictly necessary
        * Intelligible and easy to learn API, similar to those of many Python web frameworks
        * Keep the core package minimal and focused, as much as possible, on features defined in HTTP and HTML standards
        * High performance
        
        ## Server Features
        * [Routing](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep/wiki/Routing)
        * [Middlewares](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep/wiki/Middlewares)
        * [Built-in support for multi processing](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep/wiki/Built-in-multiprocessing)
        * Integration with built-in `logging` module [to log access and errors](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep/wiki/Logging) synchronously - this is completely disabled by default
        * [Chunked encoding](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep/wiki/Chunked-encoding) through generators (yield syntax)
        * [Serving static files](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep/wiki/Serving-static-files)
        * __Linux only__: support for Windows is currently out of the scope of this project
        
        This project is in alpha stage. The reason behind this framework is described in this page of the Wiki: [Story](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/BlackSheep/wiki/Story).
