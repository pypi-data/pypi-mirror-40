        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/riga/order.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/riga/order) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-order/badge/?version=latest)](http://python-order.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Package Status](https://badge.fury.io/py/order.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/order) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/riga/order.svg)](https://github.com/riga/order/blob/master/LICENSE)
        
        
        If you're designing a high-energy physics analysis (e.g. with data recorded with an [LHC](https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) experiment at [CERN](http://home.cern)), manual bookkeeping of external data can get complicated quite fast. *order* provides a Python class collection that helps you structuring
        
        - analyses,
        - MC campaigns,
        - datasets,
        - cross sections,
        - channels,
        - categories,
        - variables,
        - systematics, and
        - models for statistical inference.
        
        
        ### Getting started
        
        See the [intro.ipynb](https://github.com/riga/order/blob/master/examples/intro.ipynb) notebook for an introduction to the most important classes and an example setup of a small analysis.
        
        You can find the full [API documentation on readthedocs](http://python-order.readthedocs.io).
        
        
        ### Installation and dependencies
        
        Via [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/order):
        
        ```bash
        pip install order
        ```
        
        Currently, the only dependencies of the core classes are [scinum](https://github.com/riga/scinum) and [six](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six), which are also installed with the above command.
        
        
        ### Contributing
        
        If you like to contribute, I'm happy to receive pull requests. Just make sure to add a new test cases and run them via:
        
        ```bash
        > python -m unittest tests
        ```
        
        
        ##### Testing
        
        In general, tests should be run for different environments:
        
        - Python 2.7
        - Python 3.5
        - Python 3.6
        
        
        ##### Docker
        
        To run tests in a docker container, do:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/riga/order.git
        cd order
        
        docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/root/order -w /root/order python:3.6 /bin/bash -c "\
        	pip install -r requirements.txt; python -m unittest tests"
        ```
