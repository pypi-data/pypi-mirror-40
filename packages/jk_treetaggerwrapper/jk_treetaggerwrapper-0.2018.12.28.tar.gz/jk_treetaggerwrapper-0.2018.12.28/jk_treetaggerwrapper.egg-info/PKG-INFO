        ====================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This python module provides a wrapper around treetagger. Currently this module makes use of module `treetaggerwrapper` but this depency will be changed in the future.
        
        Information about this module can be found here:
        
        * [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-treetaggerwrapper)
        * [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_treetaggerwrapper)
        
        How to use this module
        ----------------------
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        pool = PoolOfThreadedTreeTaggers("/path/to/treetagger")
        
        result = pool.tagText2("en", "The sun is shining and the children are smiling.")
        ```
        
        In order to tag a text you first need to instantiate a pool of taggers. Then you can invoke `tagText2()` in order to temporarily allocate an instance of `TreeTagger` in the background and perform the PoS tagging.
        
        NOTE: Invoking `tagText()` is discouraged as it has been replaced with a better implementation. Nevertheless it is still available for compatibility reasons.
        
        Four arguments can be specified:
        
        * langID : A string that contains the ID of the language of the text to tag.
        * text : The text to tag.
        * bWithConfidence : A boolean value that indicates whether to return the result together with confidence value or without.
        * bWithNullsInsteadOfUnknown : A boolean value that indicates whether or not to convert "&gt;unknown&lt;" to a null-value.
        
        The result is always a list with tuples. Each tuple has the following struture:
        
        * The token itself.
        * The assigned tag.
        * The lemma.
        * The confidence value.
        
        The group consisting of tag-lemma-confidence can be returned multiple times. For example:
        
        * The token itself.
        * The assigned tag 1.
        * The lemma 1.
        * The confidence value 1.
        * The assigned tag 2 (as an alternative).
        * The lemma 2 (as an alternative).
        * The confidence value 2 (as an alternative).
        
        Concurrency
        -----------
        
        Please note that this library is based on `treetaggerwrapper` which follows a thread-based concurrency model. On tagging `treetaggerwrapper` instantiates a TreeTagger background process that is alive for the duration of the `treetaggerwrapper` object. This `treetaggerwrapper` object then communicates with this background process and uses threads for this purpose. Therefor the class `PoolOfThreadedTreeTaggers` provided by `jk_treetaggerwrapper` is bound to this limitation.
