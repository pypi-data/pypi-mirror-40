﻿jk_treetaggerwrapper
====================

Introduction
------------

This python module provides a wrapper around treetagger. Currently this module makes use of module `treetaggerwrapper` but this depency will be changed in the future.

Information about this module can be found here:

* [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-treetaggerwrapper)
* [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_treetaggerwrapper)

How to use this module
----------------------

Example:

```python
pool = PoolOfThreadedTreeTaggers("/path/to/treetagger")

result = pool.tagText2("en", "The sun is shining and the children are smiling.")
```

In order to tag a text you first need to instantiate a pool of taggers. Then you can invoke `tagText2()` in order to temporarily allocate an instance of `TreeTagger` in the background and perform the PoS tagging.

NOTE: Invoking `tagText()` is discouraged as it has been replaced with a better implementation. Nevertheless it is still available for compatibility reasons.

Four arguments can be specified:

* langID : A string that contains the ID of the language of the text to tag.
* text : The text to tag.
* bWithConfidence : A boolean value that indicates whether to return the result together with confidence value or without.
* bWithNullsInsteadOfUnknown : A boolean value that indicates whether or not to convert "&gt;unknown&lt;" to a null-value.

The result is always a list with tuples. Each tuple has the following struture:

* The token itself.
* The assigned tag.
* The lemma.
* The confidence value.

The group consisting of tag-lemma-confidence can be returned multiple times. For example:

* The token itself.
* The assigned tag 1.
* The lemma 1.
* The confidence value 1.
* The assigned tag 2 (as an alternative).
* The lemma 2 (as an alternative).
* The confidence value 2 (as an alternative).

Concurrency
-----------

Please note that this library is based on `treetaggerwrapper` which follows a thread-based concurrency model. On tagging `treetaggerwrapper` instantiates a TreeTagger background process that is alive for the duration of the `treetaggerwrapper` object. This `treetaggerwrapper` object then communicates with this background process and uses threads for this purpose. Therefor the class `PoolOfThreadedTreeTaggers` provided by `jk_treetaggerwrapper` is bound to this limitation.
