Welcome to django-test-utils. The Documentation for this project is located at https://django-test-utils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Decided to update this code for Python 3.6 with Django 1.11.14

`pip install --upgrade django-test-utils3`

Code may be subject to change frequently until fully stable.

I also updated `twill` for Python 3.6

Should be installed automatically with `django-rest-utils3` when you install it.
