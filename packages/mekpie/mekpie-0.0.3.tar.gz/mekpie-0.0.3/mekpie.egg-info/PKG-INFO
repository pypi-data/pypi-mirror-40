        # Make Building C as Simple as Pie
        
        Mekpie is an opinionated build system for small scale C projects. The core premise of Mekpie is that you should not be spending time worrying about Make files, compiler arguments, or build times, when working on a small C projects. By enforcing a simple directory structure and always providing a clean build, Mekpie saves you time and effort. For added convenience Mekpie takes notes from tools like [Rust's cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/index.html) and [Node's npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and provides options for building, running, cleaning, and testing your current project.
        
        Mekpie is a small scale project and is not supposed to replace tools like [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or provide any sort of package management capabilities. Use Mekpie when the alternative is a shoddy Make file or manually compiling.
