      # Add database user
      sudo -s -u postgres
         psql

         host your-database your-username your-ipv4 md5
         host your-database your-username your-ipv6 md5
         # host your-database your-username 0.0.0.0/0 md5
         # host your-database your-username ::0/0 md5
      sudo vim /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
         listen_addresses = 'your-ip'
         # listen_addresses = '*'
      sudo systemctl restart postgresql
