Description: # HyTouch
        
        HyTouch is a local package managing frontend for pip.
        
        ## Requirement
        
        - Python 3.7
          - Current HyTouch is hardcoded for Python 3.7. Other Python versions patch is planned
        - Hy (>= 0.15.0) https://github.com/hylang/hy
        - UNIX like CLI
        
        ## Usage
        
        Place package.hy on your project root. Example:
        
        ```hy
        (setv package {
          "dependencies"
          {"numpy" {}
           "hy==0.15.0" {}
           "jupyter" {}}
        
           "tasks"
           {"lab" ["jupyter" "lab"]
           "notebook" ["jupyter" "notebook"]
           "test" ["ls" "/home/takuma"]}})
        ```
        
        - Variable "package" required as root element
        - "dependencies" is a dictionary object, including package-name -> optional value
          - In current version, optional value is ignored
        - "tasks" is a dictionary object, including task-name -> command params array
        
        ### Install packages
        
        ```bash
        hytouch install
        ```
        
        "dependencies" will be installed to PROJECT_ROOT/.hytouch
        
        ### Run task
        
        ```bash
        hytouch run test
        ```
        
        ls command will be executed.
