      <Text>Caddy is a simple version of CAD (computer aided design) tool. It can be controlled using either a graphical user interface or a command line interface. Both enable the user to draw several basic shapes and list, move or remove them. Caddy supports drawing polylines, rectangles and circles. It is also possible to open a new file, or save and load older files. Saved representation is simply a list of commands necessary to draw corresponding shapes on the canvas. The coordinate system honors technical drawing coordinates with [0, 0] in the bottom left corner and [width, height] in top right corner.</Text>

      <Headline2>Command line interface</Headline2>
      <Text>At the bottom of the application there is a command line panel. It contains a command input area where a user can type Caddy Language commands to execute one of the possible actions. Above the input, there is a panel with a history of executed commands and with any additional command output or error messages in case there was a problem.</Text>

         <Text>Caddy Language includes:</Text>
         <Text>- Strings, which can be included anywhere they are expected (save and load commands, especially) without any quoting</Text>
         <Text>- Integers</Text>
         <Text>- Points, which can be absolute (eg. [10,20]) or relative (e.g. [+10,-20]). Relative point is calculated from the coordinates of its predecessor or from [0,0] if it does not have any preceding point</Text>

      <Headline2>Mouse interface</Headline2>
      <Text>All the actions can be also invoked by using a mouse, either by selecting an appropriate menu item or by clicking on a toolbar icon. Some actions require additional information which is provided mostly by clicking at the canvas. Current state of user interface is shown below the drawing canvas on status-bar. Executing any action through mouse interface will result in corresponding command written in command line history.</Text>
