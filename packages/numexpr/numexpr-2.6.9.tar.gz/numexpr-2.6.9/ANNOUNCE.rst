 Announcing Numexpr 2.6.9
==========================

Hi everyone, 

This is a version-bump release to provide wheels for Python 3.7.1 on Windows 
platforms.

Project documentation is available at:

http://numexpr.readthedocs.io/

Changes from 2.6.8 to 2.6.9
---------------------------

- Thanks to Mike Toews for more robust handling of the thread-setting 
  environment variables.
- With Appveyor updating to Python 3.7.1, wheels for Python 3.7 are now 
  available in addition to those for other OSes.

What's Numexpr?
---------------

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

It has multi-threaded capabilities, as well as support for Intel's
MKL (Math Kernel Library), which allows an extremely fast evaluation
of transcendental functions (sin, cos, tan, exp, log...) while
squeezing the last drop of performance out of your multi-core
processors.  Look here for a some benchmarks of numexpr using MKL:

https://github.com/pydata/numexpr/wiki/NumexprMKL

Its only dependency is NumPy (MKL is optional), so it works well as an
easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use, computational engine for projects that
don't want to adopt other solutions requiring more heavy dependencies.

Where I can find Numexpr?
