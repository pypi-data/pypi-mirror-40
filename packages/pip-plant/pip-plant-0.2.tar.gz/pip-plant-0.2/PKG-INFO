        ### Simplified Package Management for Python
        
        Plant is a simplified package manager for your Python projects.
        
        Programmers have routinely complained about `pip` not being as elegant as
        `npm` when it comes to installing dependencies. For example, with `pip`, one
        has to always specify a `requirements.txt` file for installing the packages
        needed for a project. This is an inconvenience, especially when compared to
        `npm`, which has an elegant command `npm install` to install all the
        dependencies mentioned in the project's `package.json` by default.
        
        With `plant`, Python programmers, especially the lazy ones (i.e. the good
        ones) don't have to face this inconvenience. This packages boils all of the
        hassle down to `$ pip-plant`, which simply installs all the dependencies
        mentioned in your project's `requirements.txt`.
        
        This isn't the only problem `plant` solves. More features coming soon include
        automatic requirements file updation, dependency stats (i.e. dependency usage
        proportions measurement in your project) and much more!
