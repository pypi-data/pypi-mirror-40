Introduction
------------

This package was developed to interface with the Xiaomi TV 3 series
through their local HTTP API using Python. The package has both the
ability to discover TVs and control them. The TV lineup in question is
this `one.`_ It should be noted, that all the TV logic and hardware is
in the soundbar. Thus, if you have a soundbar that looks identical to
the one in the picture, you should be golden with this library.
