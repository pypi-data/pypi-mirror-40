Remote is a tool for managing Docker applications via [Compose] on another
machine. It uses SSH tunnels to connect your Docker and Docker Compose client
with your Docker Host. It is useful as an alternative to [Machine] or to
deploy an app on a server without manually loggin in via SSH.

    $ cat docker-compose.yml
    version: '3.4'
    services:
      web:
        image: nginx
    x-docker-remote:
      project:
        name: myapp
    
    $ docker-remote compose up --build --detach
    $ docker-remote docker ps

Docker Remote sets the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable when invoking
`docker` or `docker-compose`. You can use `docker-remote shell` to enter
a shell with a tunnel set up and the environment variable set, then omit
the `docker-remote` prefix on Docker commands.

    $ docker-remote shell
    Setting up a docker-compose alias...
    
    $ alias && echo $DOCKER_HOST
    alias docker-compose='docker-remote compose'
    tcp://localhost:2375

    $ docker ps

The host to which a connection is opened can be specified in the
`x-docker-remote` section of the Docker Compose configuration or in the
`~/.docker-remote.yml` configuration file.

    remote:
      host: myhost.org
      user: me
      remotepy: /home/me/.local/bin/docker-remote.core.remotepy

The `remote.remotepy` option is necessary if the `docker-remote.core.remotepy`
command is not in the `PATH` of your user.

Check out the [Documentation](docs/) for installation instructions and
tutorials.

__Features__

* Allows you to compose and manage applications remotely
* Pre-processes your Docker Compose configuration in order to place all
  named and relative volume names inside a project directory.
* Ability to automatically add a `dockerhost` hostname to `/etc/hosts` for
  all or selected services
