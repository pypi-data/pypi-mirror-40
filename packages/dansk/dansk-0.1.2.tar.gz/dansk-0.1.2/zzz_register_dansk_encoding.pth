import dansk
# Lines beginning with import are executed by site.py
# Furthermore, they are executed alphabetically, hence the "zzz" prefix
#   so dansk.py is on path before we attempt to import it.
# These shenanigans are needed because dansk.py has to be imported
#   before our beautiful ``# coding=dansk`` programs are run, so the
#   encoding can be found.
