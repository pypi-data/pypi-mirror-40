idnits
======

The idnits program inspects IETF Internet-Draft documents for a variety of
conditions that should be adjusted to bring the document into line with
policies from the IETF, the IETF Trust, and the RFC Editor. 

The determination of which issues are to be repored is based on:

 * Requirements in https://www.ietf.org/id-info/1id-guidelines.txt
 * Requirements in https://www.ietf.org/id-info/checklist
 * Additional requirements captured from ADs and authors over time
 * Requirements in https://iaoc.ietf.org/documents/idnits-SOW-00.pdf
