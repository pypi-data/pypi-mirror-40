idnits3 (3.0.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  This introduces a re-implementation of the idnits tool in Python.

  The original idnits tool (versions 1.x and 2.x) grew from a 10-line awk
  script to more than 3000 lines of mixed bash and awk code during a period of
  17 years, and was over-ripe for re-implementation.  The new python code is
  organised so as to make it easy to add new checks and features, without
  becoming unwieldy.

  The re-implementation also introduces the ability to run idnits on IETF
  draft and RFC source files in XML format, and adds new checks that looks for
  problems with the XML source in particular.

  This release focuses on the ability to run idnits checks on XML source,
  while still containing the TXT format checks.  Additional checks related to
  both XML and TXT format input will be added in coming releases.
