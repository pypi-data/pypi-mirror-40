Description: pyotgw - A python library to interface with the OpenTherm Gateway
        
        See http://otgw.tclcode.com for the hardware.
        
        This library is written primarily for use with Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io) but can be used for other purposes as well.
        Parts of the code have not been thoroughly tested since my thermostat and boiler do not support all OpenTherm features. Feel free to test and contribute where you see fit.
