Description: OpenFlexure Motor Controller
        ============================
        This aims to be a super-simple motor controller, based on an Arduino Nano and a couple of Darlington pair ICs.  It controls cheap 28BYJ-48 steppers, as used on the OpenFlexure microscope and stage.  It owes quite a bit to [Fergus Riche's motor board](https://github.com/fr293/motor_board), the hardware developed by [OpenScope](http://2015.igem.org/Team:Cambridge-JIC) and the Arduino-based motor controller used by a number of summer students working with Richard Bowman in Cambridge, particularly James Sharkey.
        
        Contributors
        ============
        Richard Bowman (University of Bath, UK) wrote the initial version of the Arduino and Python code and maintains the module.
        Valerian Sanga (STICLab, Tanzania) did the initial PCB design & production, and maintains the PCB design
        Fergus Riche (University of Cambridge, UK) hacked the stepper library to make it work with the stepper motors we are using, and is a major contributor to the v3 PCB design.
        Boyko Vodenicharski and Filip Ayazi (University of Cambridge, UK) contributed Python 3 support, endstop support, and Arduino code that works on v3 of the hardware.
