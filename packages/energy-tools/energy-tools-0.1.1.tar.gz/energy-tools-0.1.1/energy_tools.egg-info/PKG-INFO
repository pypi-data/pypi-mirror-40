        # energy-tools
        
        Modest collection of electrical energy calculation tools.
        
        **Note**: *This repo is currently being translated to English and under heavy alterations to make it suitable for PyPi. Major changes are to be expected.*
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Requirements
        
        Basic requirements:
        
        - [Python 3.6+](http://www.python.org/download/releases/);
        - numpy.
        
        Development requirements:
        
        - pre-commit;
        - pytest;
        - twine.
        
        ### Installation energy-tools
        
        #### With pip
        
        1. Open a command prompt (e.g. Start > cmd on windows systems);
        2. Install energy-tools by running:
        
        ```
        pip install energy-tools
        ```
        
        #### Without pip
        
        If you don’t have internet access on your system or don’t want to use pip for some other reason, energy-tools can also be installed without using pip:
        
        1. Download and unzip the current energy-tools distribution from PyPi under “Download files”.
        2. Open a command prompt (e.g. Start > cmd on Windows) and navigate to the folder that contains the setup.py file with the command cd <folder> :
        
            cd %path_to_energy-tools%\energy-tools-x.x.x\
        
        
        Install energy-tools by running :
        
            python setup.py install
        
        #### Development version
        
        To install the latest development version of energy-tools from GitLab, simply follow these steps:
        
        1. Download and install git.
        2. Open a git shell and navigate to the directory where you want to keep your energy-tools files.
        3. Run the following git command:
        
            git clone https://gitlab.com/miek770/energy-tools.git
        
        4. Navigate inside the repository and check out the develop branch:
        
            cd energy-tools
            git checkout develop
        
        5. Install [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black#version-control-integration) using pre-commit:
        
            pre-commit install
        
        5. Set your Python path to the outer energy-tools folder (/energy-tools, NOT energy-tools/energy-tools).
        6. If necessary, install missing dependencies via pip install (see Development requirements above).
        
        ## Test your installation
        
        To test your installed development version, run pytest from the energy-tools' base directory:
        
            pytest
