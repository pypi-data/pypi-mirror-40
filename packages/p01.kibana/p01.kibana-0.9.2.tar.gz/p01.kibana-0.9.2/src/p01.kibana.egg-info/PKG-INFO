Description: Gevent based kibana udp client and forward server. This implementation provides
        a client and (proxy) server for send log messages from a python application to
        an elasticsearch server. The log message format provides the elasticsearch
        logstash message (v1) format which is used in kibana 4. This client/server
        implemenation allows you to send log messages from your python application to elasticsearch without to use a logstash server. The server will receive log
        message from the client and forward them to one or more elasticsearch servers. This is more or less the same as the new logstash-forwarder implementation
        supports. The implementation offers an entry_point called proxy.
        
        
        =======
        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.9.2 (2019-01-12)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: use False for verify certs as default. This is insecure and you need
          to enable explicit this option.
        
        
        0.9.1 (2019-01-11)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: adjust setup options, ensure integer for timeouts etc.
        
        
        0.9.0 (2018-02-10)
        ------------------
        
        - changed: start script option from --timeout to --elasticsearch-timeout because
          it's an elasticserach connection option.
        
        - changed: --maxminddb argument from True to maxminddb file path.
        
        - feature: Added certificate and ssl support for elasticserach client setup.
        
        
        0.8.1 (2017-01-11)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: use float for timeout instead of integer. It seems required by http3
          connection
        
        
        0.8.0 (2015-08-29)
        ------------------
        
        - implemented stdout, stderr stream logging handler usable with circus. Use
          loglevel option for enable logging. The elasticsearch.trace logging handler
          is also supported if you use the trace option.
        
        - added more comments
        
        - improved tests
        
        
        0.7.0 (2015-04-19)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: switch elasticsearch backend from udp to http protocol. Since the
          udp bulk api is deprecated switch sending received log messages via http
          to elasticsearch using the elasticsearch python client library.
        
        - feature: allow to define more then one elasticsearch server as backend in
          elasticsearch option.
        
        
        0.6.0 (2015-04-18)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: changed kibana entry_point to forwarder. This allows us to setup
          the new kibana 4 server as bin/kibana and the forwarder server as
          bin/forwarder.
        
        
        0.5.0 (2014-03-24)
        ------------------
        
        - initial release
