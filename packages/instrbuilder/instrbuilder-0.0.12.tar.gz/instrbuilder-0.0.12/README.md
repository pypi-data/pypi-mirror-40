``instrbuilder`` is an open-source Python package for control of electrical instruments. This package eases the development of high-level "drivers" to interface with oscilloscopes, power supplies, function generators, multimeters, and other instruments that use ASCII textual string communication (such as SCPI). ``instrbuilder`` is particularly suited for prototying and automating experiments in research laboratory setups within an IPython terminal.
