Dynamic runtime TWS IB API for python

Inspired in https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync but much simplier.

As the TWS-API wrapping is made dynamically, is always up-to-date with the underlying API installed version.
Is not necessary to make code maintenance tasks every time IB release a new version.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://ib-wrapper.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* TODO
- make a command line version to testing basic usages.
- make test that check a trading session using a demo account.
