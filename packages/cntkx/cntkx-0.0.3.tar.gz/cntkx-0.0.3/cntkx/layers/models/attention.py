    """
    Scaled dot-product attention implementation of "Attention is all you need", https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

    An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
    where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum
    of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
    query with the corresponding key.

    scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QV.T / sqrt(dk)) * V

    When query, key and value are all the same, it becomes self-attention.

    Example:
        a = C.sequence.input_variable(10)
        b = ScaledDotProductAttention()(a, a, a)

        assert b.shape == (10, )
