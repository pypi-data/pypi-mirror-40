This package provides a `supercanvas` widget based on the original
`tkinter` canvas.  It provides a fast useable canvas with a usual
cartesian coordinate system.

### class object

``` python3

>>> from supercanvas import *

```

Once package importation completed, you have to create a
supercanvas the usual way.

``` python3

r = tkinter.Tk()
c = supercanvas(r, bg="white", width=800, height=600)

```


### origin and units

By default, origin is located at `supercanvas`'s center and units
are both 1 pixel (and axes are drawn in french style with
arrows). You can change this with `setOrigin` and `setUnit`
methods:


 ``` python3

c.setUnit(80, 100)
c.setOrigin(50, 200)

```


### supercanvas items

`supercanvas` provides, for the moment, two items to draw `Point`
and `Line`:


* `drawPoint` method create a point at the desired coords.

``` python3

f = lambda x:x**2
x = 3
c.drawPoint(x, f(x), fill="red", outline="red")

```

It's based on `create_oval` so you can pass each option related to
`Oval` object.

* `drawLine` method create a line with a list of coords.

``` python3

c.drawLine([(-2, 2), (-1, 0), (0, 3)], fill="blue", width=3)

```

`drawLine` also supports a flat list of coords:

``` python3

c.drawLine([-2, 2, -1, 0, 0, 3], fill="blue", width=3)

```

gives the same line.

### grab/release background

You can move the whole `supercanvas` content in grabing /
realeasing the background. It will refresh coords.

### `supercanvas` options

* `axes`

passing `axes=False` to `supercanvas` options disable axes, default
is `True`. For the moment, you cannot change axes style...

* `ticks`

passing `ticks=False` to `supercanvas` options disable ticks, default is `True`. For the moment, ticks are 1-unit separated...

* `follow` 

passing `follow=False` to `supercanvas` options disable cursor follow with coords, default is `True`.


### full example

``` python3

from supercanvas import *
import math
r = tkinter.Tk()

c = supercanvas(r, bg="white", width=800, height=600, ticks=False)
c.setUnit(100, 100)

f=lambda x:math.cos(x)
g=lambda x:math.sin(x)

p = .1
a, b = -3, 3
x = a
listePointsF = []
listePointsG = []
for i in range(int(1 + (b - a) / p)):
    # creating points 
    c.drawPoint(x, f(x), fill="red", outline="red")
    # two lists
    # function f with tuples
    listePointsF += (x, f(x))
    # function g with flat list
    listePointsG += [x]+[g(x)]
    x += p

# drawings of the two curves
c.drawLine(listePointsF, fill="green")
c.drawLine(listePointsG, fill="blue", width=3)

# balancing canvas on the root
c.pack(expand=True)

# q to quit
r.bind("<q>", quit)
tkinter.mainloop()

```

### further

Much much more!


### about

supercanvas is rather an attempt to publish on the `PyPi` packages
index than a fully completed python project, I do not recommend
supercanvas usage for professionnal use. You have to consider this
package as an experiment.
