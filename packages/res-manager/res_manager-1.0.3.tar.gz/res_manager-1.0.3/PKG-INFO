Description: ============================
        Experimental Results Manager
        ============================
        
        This project helps you to handle your experimental results efficiently when doing your research. Basically it uses ``pickle`` to save and load the data, now we provide you with some high-level interfaces so that you can get rid of pickle dumping and loading from disk all the time. Also, with a given ``topic`` parameter when saving data, it can automatically build different directories for different topic.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Just start with ``from res_manager import ResultManager``, now you can create an object with ``rm = ResultManager(path)`` and then use it to save, load, clear and preview your data.
        
        ResultManager
        =============
        
        This project mainly provides:
        
        * A class named ``ResultManager`` that provides functions to save, load, clear and preview data.
        * ``ResultManager.save_data``: Save your data
        * ``ResultManager.load_data_by_name`` and ``ResultManager.load_data_by_id``: Loading data by name or ID
        * ``ResultManager.print_meta_info`` Print all meta info of saved data, including name, path, topic, comments etc.
        
        Future Plan
        ===========
        
        * Adding support to save and load figures for each piece of data
        * Adding version control to maintain different version data
        * Adding support to automatically backup data to some cloud storage
