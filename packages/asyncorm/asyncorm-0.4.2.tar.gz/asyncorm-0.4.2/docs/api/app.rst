App

The app
~~~~~~~~~~
The app (module) represents the *highest hierargical level of your program*, and should be declared in the orm definition like stated before `Usage`_
Its up to you how you will split your code, the ORM will treat all of them on the same way, so its only a SOLID separation for your conveniece.

- remember a ``__init__.py`` file should be present on each of the apps so they are correctly parsed by the python interpreter.
