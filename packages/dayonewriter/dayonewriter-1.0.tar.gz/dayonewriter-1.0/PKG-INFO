        ## Usage
        
        ### Creating an Entry with text, photo and tag
        
        ```
        from dayonewriter import Entry, dayonewriter, markdown, helper
        from datetime import datetime
        
        entry = Entry()
        # Providing datetime is compulsary
        entry.date = datetime.now() 
        
        #optionals
        entry.text = 'Hello' 
        entry.tags = ['Tag 1','Tag2']
        entry.photos = ['Photo1','Photo2'] # needs to be maximum 10. If more then checkout helper.list_subset
        entry.journal = 'Journal Name'
        
        entry_id = dayonewriter(entry) #sends to dayone using cli
        ```
        
        ### ```Entry``` class
        each new entry and has these attributes by default:
        ```
        class Entry:
            text: str = ''
            tags: list = []
            date: datetime = None
            photos: list = []
            journal: str = None
            starred: bool = False
            
            # below attributes are not tested 
            coordinate: list = []
            timezone: list = None
        ```
        
        #### Note:
        - ```date``` attribute in ```None``` by default and needs a [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) object.
        - you can use [{photo}] in entry text to position photo.
        
        ### helper
        
        Helper contains only 1 method **list_subset** to create groups of 10 from list. 
        
        Helpful when photos are more than 10.
        
        ```
        numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13] # works with any data type
        print('Without subset ', numbers)
        print('With subset' ,helper.list_subset(numbers))
        ```
        
        ### markdown
        
        contains methods which make writing markdown text easier:
        - bold
        - bullet
        - bullet_list
        - number_list
        - italic
        - dayone_link
        - photo
        - header
        - checklist
        - online_image
        - online_link
        - quote
