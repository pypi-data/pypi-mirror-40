Tinycal
===============================================================================
A Python implementation of ``cal`` command.


Story
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Mac has a built-in ``cal`` command, but it has no color at all.
It's hard to see which day is today.

I found the other ``cal`` implementation in a single C file.
After modify it's source code a little bit, I was able to build it.

And it worked for a long period of time.

One day I need to know the week number of a day.
But ``cal`` didn't provide such argument, so I have to flip my badge over and
over again.

"NO, we RD exists to solve problems! At least our own problems..."

Here comes tinycal.


Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
::

  $ pip install --upgrade tinycal

Add ``--user`` if you need.

Or, if you don't have access to PyPI, you can still install it by hand:

1.  Put the repository into your favorite folder, like ``~/bin/tinycal/``
2.  Put a shell script into ``~/bin/``, named ``tcal`` ::

      #!/usr/bin/env sh
      cd ~/bin/tinycal/ && python -m tinycal "$@"

Make sure ``~/bin/`` is in your ``$PATH``.

It's just an example, you can decide which place to put.


Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tinycal comes with a command utility ``tcal``.
It's command line argument design is mostly based on traditional ``cal``.

A snapshot of help page here:

Configuration File
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, you still reading :D

tinycal finds its configuration file in this order:

1.  ``~/.config/calrc``
2.  ``~/.calrc``

Here is the full set of configurable options, with default values:

::

  col = 3
  after = 0
  before = 0
  wk = false
  sep = true
  fill = false
  border = true
  start_monday = false
  lang = en

  wk.color = BLACK
  fill.color = BLACK
  title.color = none:none
  weekday.color = none:none
  weekday.sunday.color = none:none
  weekday.monday.color = none:none
  weekday.tuesday.color = none:none
  weekday.wednesday.color = none:none
  weekday.thursday.color = none:none
  weekday.friday.color = none:none
  weekday.saturday.color = none:none
  sunday.color = none:none
  monday.color = none:none
  tuesday.color = none:none
  wednesday.color = none:none
  thursday.color = none:none
  friday.color = none:none
  saturday.color = none:none
  today.color = none:white

The ordering is not important.

For color settings, use ``foreground:background`` format to describe colors.

Recognized colors: ``black``, ``red``, ``green``, ``yellow``, ``blue``, ``magenta``, ``cyan``, ``white``.

If every letter in foreground is capitalized, the color will be bright.

Several color configuration may refer to the same day (like today & saturday).
The more specific setting overrides the other.

For example, this configuration:

::

  col = 5
  sep = true
  wk = true
  border = true
  fill = true

  title.color = black:cyan
  wk.color = black:white
  today.color = RED
  weekday.color = YELLOW
  weekday.sunday.color = GREEN
  weekday.saturday.color = GREEN

looks like this:

If it looks ugly, I'm sorry :(

But you can design your own configuration anyway :)
