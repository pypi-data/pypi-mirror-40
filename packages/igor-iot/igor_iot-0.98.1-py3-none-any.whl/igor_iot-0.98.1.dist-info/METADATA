# Igor, your personal IoT butler

Igor is named after the Discworld characters of the same name. 
You should think of it as a butler (or valet, or majordomo, 
I am not quite sure of the difference) that knows everything 
that goes on in your household, and makes sure everything runs smoothly. 
It performs its tasks without passing judgements and maintains complete 
discretion, even within the household. It can work together with other Igors 
(lending a hand) and with lesser servants such as [Iotsa-based devices](https://github.com/cwi-dis/iotsa).

**Please note:** Igor is not a finished product yet, some functionality may be missing. Specifically, the security and privacy mechanisms are not complete yet.

## Overview

Igor is primarily an XML database. It has a REST interface to communicate to the outside world, and it can emit requests as well.
It performs its tasks of managing your household by knowing three things:

1. what is going on at the moment,
2. what needs to happen when, and
3. how to make that happen.

Igor has a plugin mechanism, and you can add plugins for all kinds of sensors (point 1). You can also add plugins that can control external devies (point 3). Finally you add rules to connect these (point 2).

Igor has a web interface to allow you to control and maintain it.
It also comes with a number of useful plugins and a set of Python modules and command line utilities that interact with it.

## Documentation

Formatted documentation is available online, at <https://igor-iot.readthedocs.io>.

When viewing source documentation is also available [here](doc/index.rst). 


## Getting Started

You need to have Python 3.6 or later installed.
(Python 2.7 is also still supported but Python 3 is preferred).

You need the _pip_ package manager for the version of Python that you are going to use.

```
python3 -m pip install igor-iot
```

After that follow the instructions in <https://igor-iot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>
or [doc/setup.rst](doc/setup.rst) to setup your Igor system.
