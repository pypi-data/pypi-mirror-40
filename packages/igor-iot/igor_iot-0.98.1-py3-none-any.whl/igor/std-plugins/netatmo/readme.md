# netatmo - get environmental data from a NetAtmo weather station

This plugin gets data from a [NetAtmo](http://netatmo.com) weather station through their cloud API.

Raw data is stored in `sensors/netAtmo` with one element per weather station (using the names the user assigned to the stations).

Parsed weather data is stored in `environment/weather`.

Currently the plugin (and the underlying script) only get temperature data for each station and is more a proof-of-concept than anything else.
