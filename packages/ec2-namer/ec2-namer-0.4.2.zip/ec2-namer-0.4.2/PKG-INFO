        About
        -----
        
        Startup script - Modifies tags, hostname and public DNS routes based on EC2 some tags
        
        Tag your ec2 instance with the following : 
        
         - 'group': 'compute' / 'webserver'
         - 'number': '0001'
         - 'zone': 'my-dns.com'
         - 'environment': 'dev' / 'prod'
        
        If another machine is found with same tags, the number tag will be incremented (or updated with non existing one at least).
        You can then duplicate an instance with its tags, and these tags will be updated to make the host unique (hostname and DNS route pointing to it).
        
        And a public route in the form of {group}-{number}.{env}.{zone}. For example : webserver-0001.dev.my_dns.com
        
        Internal hostname will also be set to {group}-{number}.{env} like webserver-0001.dev.
        
        Works on linux and windows (but needs a reboot once in windows after changing hostname).
