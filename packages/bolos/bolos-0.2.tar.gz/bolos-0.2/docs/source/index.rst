Documentation for bolos
=======================

``BOLOS`` is a BOLtzmann equation solver Open Source library.  

This package provides a pure Python library for the solution of the 
Boltzmann equation for electrons in a non-thermal plasma.  It builds upon
previous work, mostly by G. J. M. Hagelaar and L. C. Pitchford [HP2005]_, 
who developed `BOLSIG+`_.  ``BOLOS`` is a multiplatform, open source 
implementation of a similar algorithm compatible with the `BOLSIG+`_ 
cross-section input format.


The code was developed by `Alejandro Luque <http://www.iaa.es/~aluque>`_ at the 
`Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía <http://www.iaa.es>`_ (IAA), `CSIC <http://www.csic.es>`_ and is released under the `LGPLv2 License`_. Packages can be 
downloaded from the project `homepage`_ on PyPI. The 
`source code`_ can be obtained from
GitHub, which also hosts the `bug tracker`_. The `documentation`_  can be
read on ReadTheDocs.
