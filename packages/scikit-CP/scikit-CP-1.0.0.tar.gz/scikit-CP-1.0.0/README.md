# scikit-CP
scikit-CP is a computational physics simulation and modeling python scientific library. It is intended
for students or scientists seeking to integrate physics computational solutions into their python 
projects. It is written in and only compatible with Python 3. 

## Available modules
Below is the currently available stable classes and simulation scripts, more are on the way.
Contributions are welcomed, but they mus follow the format of the project and be coded either as a 
simulation script or a class file for a physical object. A contribution tutorial is coming soon.

### Classical Mechanics
Classes:
 + Oscillator
 + Planet
 + Projectile
 
Simulation scripts:
 + Projectiles Collision Detector
