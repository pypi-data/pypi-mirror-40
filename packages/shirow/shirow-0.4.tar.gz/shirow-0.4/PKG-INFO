        Shirow
        ======
        
        Shirow is an RPC server framework based on top of
        `Tornado <http://tornadoweb.org/en/stable/>`__. It relies on the
        WebSocket protocol for transport and uses JSON-messages as payload.
        
        The project was named after Masamune Shirow, a mangaka who is best known
        for such mangas as `Black
        Magic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Magic_(manga)>`__,
        `Appleseed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appleseed_(manga)>`__ and
        `Ghost in the
        Shell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(manga)>`__.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        The primary goal of Shirow is to simplify creating microservices using
        Tornado, allowing clients to leverage some Django facilities. Thus,
        Shirow expands the Tornado implementation of the WebSocket protocol with
        an authentication layer, so that clients have to be authenticated using
        the `Django authentication
        system <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/auth/>`__ to
        connect to the RPC server. The client has to pass a valid token to the
        RPC server, which was received after a successful authentication
        procedure, to prove Shirow that it's an authenticated. See the
        `create\_token\_if\_needed <https://github.com/tolstoyevsky/shirow/tree/master/django-shirow>`__
        decorator to learn how to make Django views create the tokens.
