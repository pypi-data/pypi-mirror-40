    Get DFG graph from Pandas dataframe

    Parameters
    -----------
    df
        Dataframe
    measure
        Measure to use (frequency/performance/both)
    activity_key
        Activity key to use in the grouping
    case_id_glue
        Case ID identifier
    timestamp_key
        Timestamp key
    perf_aggregation_key
        Performance aggregation key (mean, median, min, max)
    sort_required
        Specify if a sort on the Case ID and the timestamp is required

    Returns
    -----------
    dfg
        DFG in the chosen measure (may be only the frequency, only the performance, or both)
