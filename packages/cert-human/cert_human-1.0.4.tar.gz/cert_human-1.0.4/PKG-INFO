        Cert Human: SSL Certificates for Humans
        =======================================
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        Somebody said something about over-engineering. So I obviously had to chime in.
        
        No, but seriously, I was in the midst of rewriting [another project of mine](https://github.com/tanium/pytan), and I wanted to incorporate a method to get an SSL certificate from a server, show the user the same kind of information as you'd see in a browser, prompt them for validity, then write it to disk for use in all [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) to a server.
        
        I was unable to find any great / easy ways that incorporated all of these concepts into one neat thing. So I made a thing.
        
        Originally this was based off of yet another lovely over-engineered solution in [get-ca-py](https://github.com/neozenith/get-ca-py) by [Josh Peak](https://github.com/neozenith).
