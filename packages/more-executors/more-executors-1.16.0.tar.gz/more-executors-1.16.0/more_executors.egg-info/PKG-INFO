        ==============

        -  `API documentation <https://rohanpm.github.io/more-executors/>`__
        -  `Source <https://github.com/rohanpm/more-executors>`__
        -  `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/more-executors>`__
        
        This library is intended for use with the
        ```concurrent.futures`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html>`__
        module. It includes a collection of ``Executor`` implementations in
        order to extend the behavior of ``Future`` objects.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Futures with implicit retry
        -  Futures with implicit cancel on executor shutdown
        -  Futures with implicit cancel after timeout
        -  Futures with transformed output values (sync & async)
        -  Futures resolved by a caller-provided polling function
        -  Throttle the number of futures running at once
        -  Synchronous executor
        -  Bridge ``concurrent.futures`` with ``asyncio``
        -  Convenience API for creating executors
        
        See the `API
        documentation <https://rohanpm.github.io/more-executors/>`__ for
        detailed information on usage.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        This example combines the map and retry executors to create futures for
        HTTP requests running concurrently, decoding JSON responses within the
        future and retrying on error.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import requests
            from concurrent.futures import as_completed
            from more_executors import Executors
        
        
            def get_json(response):
                response.raise_for_status()
                return (response.url, response.json())
        
        
            def fetch_urls(urls):
                # Configure an executor:
                # - run up to 4 requests concurrently, in separate threads
                # - run get_json on each response
                # - retry up to several minutes on any errors
                executor = Executors.\
                    thread_pool(max_workers=4).\
                    with_map(get_json).\
                    with_retry()
        
                # Submit requests for each given URL
                futures = [executor.submit(requests.get, url)
                           for url in urls]
        
                # Futures API works as normal; we can block on the completed
                # futures and map/retry happens implicitly
                for future in as_completed(futures):
                    (url, data) = future.result()
                    do_something(url, data)
