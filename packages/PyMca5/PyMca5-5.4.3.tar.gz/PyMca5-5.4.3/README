This is the MIT version of the PyMca XRF Toolkit.
Please read the LICENSE file for details.

INSTALLATION

Ready-to-use packages are available for the most common platforms.

PyMca frozen binaries for MacOS and windows can be obtained from sourceforge:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/pymca/files/pymca/

Unofficial debian packages are also available, but you should check if official pacakges are available for your distribution.

Please keep going if you want to use PyMca with your existing Python installation.

The simplest solution is to use pip:

pip install PyMca5

You can add the usual --user qualifier to install only for you:

pip install PyMca5 --user

If you want to build from source distribution or from a github checkout, you may want to have
cython installed on your system.

Examples of installation from the sources.

1 - In your default python installation:

python setup.py install

or (better)

pip install .

2 - In your user account:

python setup.py install --user

or

pip install --user

You will need:

- Python (one of 2.7, 3.5 or higher recommended)

- Numpy

- fisx

If you want to use the graphical interfaces provided, you will need a running
python installation with one of:

- PyQt4 + matplotlib (PyMca license will be GPL unless you have a commercial PyQt4 license)
- PyQt5 + matplotlib (PyMca license will be GPL unless you have a commercial PyQt5 license)
- PySide + matplotlib (PyMca license will be MIT because PySide is LGPL)

If you want to embed PyMca in your own graphical applications, I recommend you to use
the McaAdvancedFit.py module. It is very easy to embed.

DEVELOPMENT PLANS

- Use the fisx library for all Physics calculations and not just for corrections.

- Compound fitting.
