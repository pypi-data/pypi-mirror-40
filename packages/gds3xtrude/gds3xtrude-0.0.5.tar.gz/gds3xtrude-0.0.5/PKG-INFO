Description: # gds3xtrude
        A simple layout to 3D converter.
        
        This tool converts a GDS layout into a OpenSCAD 3D model.

        ## Dependencies
        * OpenSCAD: 3D modelling tool. Can be installed using the package manager of most linux distributions.
        * solidpython: Python library for creating OpenSCAD models.
        * klayout: Python module of KLayout used for GDS input/output and polygon operations.
        
        ## Install from Git
        ```sh
        git clone [this repo]
        cd gds3xtrude
        python3 setup.py install --user
        ```
        
        For standalone usage the `klayout` Python package must be installed too. Otherwise gds3xtrude is only usable from the KLayout GUI.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Example usage:
        ```sh
        gds3xtrude --tech tech_freepdk45.layerstack --input [path to freepdk]/NAND2X1.gds --output NAND2X1.scad
        
        # Then run openscad to view the result.
        openscad NAND2X1.scad
        ```
        
        ### Layer stack definition
        To convert a 2D layout into a 3D model some information about the physical layer stack is necessary.
        This information must be passed to gds3xtrude as a file. An example of a simple layer stack description
        for the FreePDK45 can be found in `examples/freepdk45.layerstack`. Use this file as a starting point and adapt it to your needs.
        
        Essentially a layerstack file is just a python script that defines some data structures.
        
        Example:
        ```python
        from gds3xtrude.include import layer
        
        # Define layers
        poly = layer(15)
        contact = layer(16)
        metal1 = layer(21)
        
        # Define colors (optional)
        poly.color = [0.8, 0.2, 0.2]
        metal1.color = [0.2, 0.2, 0.8]
        
        # Define additional layers from boolean operation
        contact_to_silicon = contact - poly
        
        # Define layer stack structure as a list of (layer thickness, [masks, ...]).
        layerstack = [
            (10, contact_to_silicon),
            (20, [contact, poly]),
            (200, contact),
            (50, metal1),
        ]
        ```
        
        ## KLayout Module
        gds3xtrude is intended to be used from KLayout. Currently the module is not yet registered as a KLayout package, but can be used by manually copying `klayout/gds3xtrude.lym` into `.klayout/pymacros`.
        
        ## FreeCAD / Blender
        The generated OpenSCAD models (.scad) can be imported into FreeCAD. If you want to use Blender for rendering, export the model from FreeCAD as a Wavefront (.obj) file. This can be imported in blender.
        
        ### Color Issue
        When applying a boolean union FreeCAD strips away colors. Therefore an exported .obj model will by totally gray. There is a workaround:
        * Open the OpenSCAD model in FreeCAD
        * Open the `Model` tab in `Combo View`
        * Expand the list of the imported model which is likely to be named `Unnamed`
        * Find a child node labelled `union`, select and delete it
        * Select the full model to be exported (Ctrl-A)
        * Now you can export to .obj without loosing color information
        
        Additionally to the .obj file FreeCAD will also create a .mtl file containing material/color information. Blender will automatically read it when importing the .obj file.
