**XenonPy** is a Python library that implements a comprehensive set of machine learning tools
for materials informatics. Its functionalities partially depend on PyTorch and R.
The current release (v0.2.0, 2018/12/25) is just a prototype version, which provides some limited modules:

* Interface to public materials database
* Library of materials descriptors (compositional/structural descriptors)
* Pretrained model library **XenonPy.MDL** (v0.1.0b, 2018/12/25: more than 10,000 modles in 35 properties of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic compounds)
* Machine learning tools.
* Transfer learning using the pretrained models in XenonPy.MDL

XenonPy inspired by matminer: https://hackingmaterials.github.io/matminer/.

XenonPy is a open source project https://github.com/yoshida-lab/XenonPy.
