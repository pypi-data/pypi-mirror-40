Description: The ILAMB Benchmarking System
        =============================
        
        The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project is a
        model-data intercomparison and integration project designed to improve
        the performance of land models and, in parallel, improve the design of
        new measurement campaigns to reduce uncertainties associated with key
        land surface processes. Building upon past model evaluation studies,
        the goals of ILAMB are to:
        
        * develop internationally accepted benchmarks for land model
          performance, promote the use of these benchmarks by the
          international community for model intercomparison,
        * strengthen linkages between experimental, remote sensing, and
          climate modeling communities in the design of new model tests and
          new measurement programs, and
        * support the design and development of a new, open source,
          benchmarking software system for use by the international community.
        
        It is the last of these goals to which this repository is
        concerned. We have developed a python-based generic benchmarking
        system, initially focused on assessing land model performance.

        ILAMB 2.4 Release
        -----------------
        
        This release marks an important technical shift in ILAMB
        development--ILAMB v2.4 and onward will be python3 only. If you are
        new to python, it might seem strange that python3 has been released
        for 10 years and yet python2 is still ubiquitous. There is now an
        official `announcement <https://pythonclock.org/>`_ that python2 will
        reach its end of life at the end of 2019. Furthermore there is a
        growing `list <https://python3statement.org/>`_ of popular python
        packages (most of our dependencies) that are phasing out support for
        python2 during this year. So in keeping with this community trend, the
        last version of ILAMB which will be compatible with python2.7x is
        2.3.1, version 2.4 and beyond will by python3 only.
        
        Part of my reason for sticking with python2 for so long was that ILAMB
        was designed to run on large machines whose software stacks are often
        not frequently updated. I wanted to ensure that ILAMB would run on old
        software. However, this is less an issue as computing centers are
        moving away from providing users with python packages they load via
        center-supported environment modules and towards users creating
        personalized environments using `conda
        <https://conda.io/docs/>`_. Look for the ``ilamb.yml`` file in the
        repository which conda can use to create an environment that will
        support an ILAMB installation. If these words do not mean anything to
        you, look for a more detailed explanation in the `tutorials
        <https://www.ilamb.org/doc/install.html>`_ which have be rewritten to
        reflect this shift.
        
        We have published a `paper <https://doi.org/10.1029/2018MS001354>`_ in
        JAMES which details the methodology which this package implements. If
        you find ILAMB helpful in your research, we would appreciate a
        citation to this work as it helps us communicate the impact that these
        investments have on the community.
        
        The collection of land surface confrontations now includes the
        emulation of CO\ :sub:`2`\ fluxes. The default setup is to compare
        ``nbp`` fluxes to those recorded at a subset of NOAA sites, but this
        is configurable from inside the configure file. Browse the CMIP5
        `output
        <https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP5/esmHistorical/EcosystemandCarbonCycle/CarbonDioxide/NOAA.Emulated/NOAA.Emulated.html>`_
        for an overview of what this addition provides.
        
        Finally, we are making some shifts in how we support ILAMB. Until now,
        I have directed user questions to my personal email. This is still ok,
        however consider `joining
        <https://www.ilamb.org/mailman/listinfo/ilamb-users>`_ the ILAMB
        mailing list and sending your questions there. Not only does this open
        up your question to being answered more quickly by the community, but
        the answers are searchable which may help the next user. In addition
        to this, we have a Slack `channel
        <https://ilamb-community.slack.com/>`_ if you prefer to ask your
        questions there. This has more of a chat interface but the
        conversations are all still public and searchable by the members.
