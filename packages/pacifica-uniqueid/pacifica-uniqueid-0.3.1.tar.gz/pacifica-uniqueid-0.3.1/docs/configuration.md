# Configuration

The Pacifica Core services require two configuration files. The REST
API utilizes [CherryPy](https://github.com/cherrypy) and review of
their
[configuration documentation](http://docs.cherrypy.org/en/latest/config.html)
is recommended. The service configuration file is a INI formatted
file containing configuration for database connections.

## CherryPy Configuration File

An example of UniqueID server CherryPy configuration:

```
[global]
log.screen: True
log.access_file: 'access.log'
log.error_file: 'error.log'
server.socket_host: '0.0.0.0'
server.socket_port: 8051

[/]
request.dispatch: cherrypy.dispatch.MethodDispatcher()
tools.response_headers.on: True
tools.response_headers.headers: [('Content-Type', 'application/json')]
```

## Service Configuration File

The service configuration is an INI file and an example is as follows:

```ini
[database]
; This section contains database connection configuration

; peewee_url is defined as the URL PeeWee can consume.
; http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html#connecting-using-a-database-url
peewee_url = sqliteext:///db.sqlite3

; connect_attempts are the number of times the service will attempt to
; connect to the database if unavailable.
connect_attempts = 10

; connect_wait are the number of seconds the service will wait between
; connection attempts until a successful connection to the database.
connect_wait = 20
```
