# Awlsim - S7 compatible Programmable Logic Controller (PLC/SPS)

Awlsim is a free Step 7 compatible Programmable Logic Controller, that supports the automation languages AWL/STL and FUP/FBD. Awlsim itself is written in Python.

The latest version of Awlsim can be downloaded at the [official Awlsim site](https://awlsim.de).


## Awlsim - Programmable Logic Controller (PLC/SPS)

Awlsim is a free Step 7 compatible Programmable Logic Controller, that supports the automation languages AWL/STL and FUP/FBD. Awlsim itself is written in Python. The speed of execution ranges from several ten thousand AWL/STL instructions per second on slow embedded machines to a couple of million instructions per second on faster computers.

AWL/STL programs on PLCs are used for automation of industrial processes. However Awlsim is very flexible, so it can be used for other purposes beyond industrial applications, too. Awlsim aims to be compatible with the industry standard S7 software on the AWL/STL level.

Awlsim can emulate CPUs with two and four accumulator registers (S7-3xx and S7-4xx). Compatibility to S7 hardware is a task taken seriously by the Awlsim project. We want to be as close as possible to the real PLC hardware with our AWL/STL code execution. For this reason Awlsim ships an extensive selftest suite. Missing features and differences between Awlsim and Step 7 are documented in the [COMPATIBILITY documentation](COMPATIBILITY.html) and [TODO documentation](TODO.html) files.


## Quick start tutorial

See the [quick start tutorial](QUICK-START.html) for a simple example on how to use Awlsim in simulator mode. In simulator mode Awlsim can be run on any desktop PC. No special hardware is required.


## Example project

If you don't know where to start, you can find an example project in the `examples` directory as `EXAMPLE.awlpro`. You can easily run this example in simulation mode without the need for special hardware.


## Git repository

The latest development version of Awlsim can be fetched with git:

<pre>
git clone https://git.bues.ch/git/awlsim.git
cd awlsim
</pre>

After cloning the main repository the git submodules must also be fetched. The following helper script can be used:

<pre>
./maintenance/update-submodules
</pre>


## Dependencies

Awlsim depends on

* [Python](https://python.org) 3.4 or later or alternatively Python 2.7
* [PyQT 5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) or alternatively [PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide)
* [CFFI](http://cffi.readthedocs.org/)

These packages can be installed with pip:

<pre>
pip3 install --upgrade PyQt5
pip3 install --upgrade cffi
</pre>

If building and using Awlsim with Cython acceleration is desired, Cython must also be installed:

<pre>
pip3 install --upgrade Cython
</pre>

On Windows all Awlsim dependencies can be installed by double clicking the shipped installer script: *maintenance\win-install-dependencies.cmd*

For Debian Linux users the script *maintenance/deb-dependencies-install.sh* installs all required and optional runtime and build dependencies.

## FUP - Funktionsplan - Function block diagram

Awlsim supports programming in an S7-FUP like language. See [the FUP documentation](doc/fup/FUP.html) for more information about Awlsim's implementation of FUP.


## Building Awlsim

Awlsim can be run from the source directory in interpreted Python mode without building it. Just `cd` into the Awlsim source directory and execute the desired main executable (e.g. `./awlsim-gui` or `./awlsim-server` etc...).

The accelerated Cython libraries can be built with the standard Python `./setup.py build` command.

For convenience there also is a helper script `./maintenance/build.sh`, which will do everything right to build Awlsim. That can be used instead of calling setup.py directly.

There also is `./maintenance/build-noopt.sh`. That builds Cython modules without optimization. The build is much faster, but the resulting Cython libraries will be much slower. This is useful for development. Do not use this for production.


## Building Debian / Raspbian / PiLC .deb packages

Installing or upgrading Awlsim on a Debian based system is easy.
The `debuild` can be used to build the .deb packages. Just run the following commands to build all Awlsim .deb packages:

<pre>
cd path/to/awlsim                                 # Go to Awlsim source directory
sudo ./maintenance/deb-dependencies-install.sh    # This installs all dependencies
debuild -uc -us                                   # Build all Awlsim .deb packages
sudo ./maintenance/deb-install.sh ..              # Install or upgrade all Awlsim .deb packages
</pre>

The .deb files will be put into the parent directory of the Awlsim source directory.

If you get the following build failure during build:

`/usr/include/features.h:xxx:xx: fatal error: sys/cdefs.h: No such file or directory`

this can be fixed by re-installing the libc development package:

`sudo apt install --reinstall libc-dev`
