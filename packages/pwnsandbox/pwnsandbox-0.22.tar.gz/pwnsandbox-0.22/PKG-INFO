Description: # PwnSandboxForCTF
        Yet another sandbox for CTF challenge in AWD mode
        
        This is a ptrace sandbox. ~~(It was a chroot sandbox)~~
        
        It will send PTRACE_KILL under certain circumstances:
        
        * Child process attempting to open files with 'flag' in its name by open or openat. (/tmp/asdflagasd etc.)
        * Child process attempting to call illegal syscall. (execve/execveat)
        
        ELF64 and ELF32 supported, including PIE
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install pwnsandbox
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        It will install a console script 'pwn_sandbox'.
        ## Usage
        
        ```bash
        usage: pwn_sandbox [-h] input_bin

        positional arguments:
          input_bin   /path/to/your/input binary
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
        ```
        There will be a binary output named binary_sandbox in your binary's folder
        
        ## Requirement
        
        * python 2.7
        * pwntools
        * ~~lief~~ Already included in project cause newest lief [sucks](https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF/issues/143).
        
        ## Known issues
        
        * ~~Centos **NOT supported**~~
        * Might crash on ELF contains multi loadable segments. (I haven't seen this type of ELF yet)
        * Sandbox might be bypassable, but it isn't designed as an impenetrable shield anyway.
        * DO NOT use newest lief or you will be fucked when processing non-pie ELF32 file.
        
        ## TODO
        
        * ~~Find a clean method to jump back to oep~~
        * ~~New method to support centos~~
