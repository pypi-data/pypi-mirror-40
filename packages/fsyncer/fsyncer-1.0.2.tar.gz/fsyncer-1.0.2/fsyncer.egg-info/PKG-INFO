Description: Fork Syncer -- Fsyncer
        ======================

        This is a small python application to keep all your remote forks up-to-date.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ::
        
            pip install fsyncer
        
        
        Running
        -------
        
        From a cron job for example which runs every day / week / month...
        
        ::
        
            export FSYNC_GITHUB_TOKEN=<github_token_with_repo_access_scope>
            fsyncer
        
        
        Filter Repositories
        -------------------
        
        It's possible to provide a list of repositories that Fsyncer should deal with.
        In that case, the list of forks will be filtered down to the provided list.
        That files location is `~/.config/fsyncer/.repo_list`.
        
        Example::
        
            my_awesome_repo
            my_other_awesome_repo
            and_sync_this_one
        
        In this case if there are other repositories for that user, they will all be
        ignored and only these three will be synced.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Fsynver runs `git` in the background on the given environment. If the installed
        `git` can push to a repository then so can Fsyncer. Hence the requirement is
        only to have a valid git client with properly set up credentials.
        
        fsyncer also requires a token to be present on the current machine to gather
        data, like remote forks and username.
        
        This environment property is `FSYNC_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
        
        Restrictions
        ============
        
        Only forks can be updated which can be fast forwarded for now. Fsyncer will
        not try to do git magic or trying to resolve merge conflicts. If the push
        doesn't work, it will skip that repository and move on to the next one.
        
        Future
        ========
        
        Future plans include:
        
        1. Creating a cron job with an optional parameter for the current user
        2. Documentation
        3. Support other VCSs
