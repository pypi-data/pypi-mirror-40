Chart Service will attempt to make public functions (not prefixed with _) from this module available. Such functions
should be fully documented: docstrings should describe parameters and the return value, and provide a 1-line
description. Type annotations should be provided for parameters.

The technical analysis timeseries library contains functions which compute technical indicators. These include basic
timeseries operations (moving average), and finance-specific technical indicators (e.g. bollinger bands)
