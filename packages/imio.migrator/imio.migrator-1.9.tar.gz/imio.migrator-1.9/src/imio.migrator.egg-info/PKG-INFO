        - Added method `warn` that manages warning messages, it will display the warning
          like before in the Zope log but will also store it so every warnings are
          displayed togheter at the end of the migration.

        - Method `reinstall` may now receive paremeters `ignore_dependencies` and
          `dependency_strategy` to use it when calling `portal_setup.runAllImportStepsFromProfile`.
