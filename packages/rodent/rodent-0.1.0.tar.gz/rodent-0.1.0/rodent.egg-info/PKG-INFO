Description: # Rodent
        A simple CLI utility that can add license headers to your files.
        
        ## Motives
        Attempted using the Apache RAT https://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat/index.html
        and failed. Had to download the Java SDK, executed the thing and got a
        Java error.
        
        # Features
        
        * `rodent list`: lists the files that are in scope (git-aware, only includes
          files tracked by git)
        * `rodent check`: allows to break a build when a new file without
          header is introduced in the code base, logs all non-compliant files
        * `rodent apply`: mass inserts Apache license headers throughout large
           code bases
        
        All commands receive a `-f` `--file-regex` argument that allow to filter
        files that are affected.
        
        ## Limitations
        
        * Currently only works for py/js/jsx, can easily be extended to support
          more file types
