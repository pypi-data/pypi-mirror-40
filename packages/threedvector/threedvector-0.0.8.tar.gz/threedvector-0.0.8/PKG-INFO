Description: # threedvector Package
        
        threedvector is a package providing common methods for working with 3D vectors in both Spherical and Cartesian coordinates.
        
        Vectors are stored in Spherical format but can be created in both Spherical and Cartesian formats.
        
        ## Methods
        
        ### ___init__(radius_x=0, theta_y=0, phi_z=0, coords="spherical")_
        Default Vector creation is in the Spherical coordinate system with `radius_x` representing the length of the vector, `theta_y` the angle theta and  `phi_z` the angle phi.  A Vector can be created using Cartesian coordinates when `coords` is set to "cartesian".  In this case `radius_x` represents the `x` coordinate, `theta_y` the `y` coordinate and  `phi_z` the `z` coordinate.
        
        ### _to_spherical([x, y, z])_
        Returns a Vector object based on `[x, y, z]` Cartesian cooridates.
        
        ### _to_cartesian()_
        Returns a list in the form of `[x, y, z]` representing the corresponding Cartesian coordinates for a vector.
        
        ### _is_same(s_vector)_
        Compares the length as well as angles theta and phi of vector and `s_vector` to determine equality.  This is different to '=' which only checks for equality of the vector length.
        
        ### _dot(s_vector)_
        Returns the resultant scalar dot product of a vector with `s_vector`.
        
        ### _cross(s_vector)_
        Returns  `Vector` resulting from the cross product of a vector with `s_vector`.
        
        ### _angle(s_vector)_
        Returns the in-plane angle between a vector and `s_vector`.
        
        ### _magnitude()_
        Returns the length of a vector.
        
        ### _unit()_
        Returns the corresponding unit vector of a vector.
        
        ### _addition_ and _subtraction_
        Returns resulting Vector.  Normal addition and subtraction is done through Cartesian addition and subtraction operations.
        
        ### _multplication_
        Multiplication is implemented as scalar multiplication only.  For dot and cross products the corresponding methods should be used.
        
        ### _comparison_
        All comparison operators returns comparison with length of vectors only.
        
        ## Atributes
        
        ### _radius_
        Returns the length of a vector
        
        ### _theta_
        Returns the angle theta of a vector in degrees
        
        ### _phi_
        Returns the ancle phi of a vector in degrees
