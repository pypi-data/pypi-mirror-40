Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `exceptbool` for local development.

1. Fork the `exceptbool` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/exceptbool.git

3. Prepare your development environment in a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkvirtualenv exceptbool
    $ cd exceptbool/
    $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

4. Create a branch for local development:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

5. Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, add the
   feature to the list in README.rst and update HISTORY.rst.
3. Increase version number in exceptbool/__init__.py
4. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/konrad-kocik/exceptbool/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed.
Then run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make release
