# mujson

`mujson` lets python libraries make use of the most performant JSON functions available at import time. It is small, and does not itself implement any encoding or decoding functionality.

## installation

Install with:

``` shell
$ pip install --upgrade mujson
```

## rationale

JSON decoding and encoding is a common application bottleneck, and a variety of "fast" substitutes for the standard library's `json` exist, typically implemented in C. This is great for projects which can fine tune their dependency trees, but third party libraries are often forced to rely on the standard library so as to avoid superfluous or expensive requirements.

It is common for libraries to use guarded imports (i.e. `try... except` logic), hoping to find some better JSON implementation available. But this approach is sub-optimal. There are many python JSON libraries, and the relative performance of these varies between encoding and decoding, as well as between Python 2 and 3.

`mujson` just uses the most performant JSON functions available, with the option to specify what JSON implementations are best for your project. It may also be of use to developers who don't always want to worry about compiling C extensions, but still want performance in production.

## usage

For simple usage:

```python
import mujson as json

json.loads(json.dumps({'hello': 'world!'}))
```

To customize the ranked preference of JSON libraries, including libraries not contemplated by `mujson`:

``` python
from mujson import mujson_function

FAST_JSON_LIBS = ['newjsonlib', 'orjson', 'ujson', 'rapidjson', 'yajl']

fast_dumps = mujson_function('fast_dumps', ranking=FAST_JSON_LIBS)
```

`mujson` implements one additional set of custom mujson functions, called "compliant". These functions use a ranking that excludes JSON libraries that do not support the function signatures supported by corresponding functions in the standard library.

```python
import logging

from mujson import compliant_dumps
from pythonjsonlogger import jsonlogger

logger = logging.getLogger()

logHandler = logging.StreamHandler()
# NOTE: we use `compliant_dumps` because the `JsonFormmatter` makes use of
# kwargs like `cls` and `default` which not all json libraries support. (This
# would not strictly be a concern if this was the only use of mujson in a given
# application, but better safe than sorry.)
formatter = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter(json_serializer=compliant_dumps)
logHandler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(logHandler)
```

## default rankings

`mujson`'s default rankings are scoped to function and python version. The default rankings are based on the benchmarked performance of common JSON libraries encoding and decoding the JSON data in [bench/json](bench/json). [`bench/json/tweet.json`](bench/json/tweet.json) was given the most weight, under the assumption that it most closely resembles common application data.

### PyPy

When [PyPy](https://pypy.org/) is used, `mujson` simply falls back to the standard library's `json`, as it currently outperforms all third party libaries.

## running benchmarks

You can build the python 3 benchmarking environment from within the bench directory with something like:

``` shell
$ docker build -t mujson-bench:py3 -f py3.Dockerfile .
```

And you can run the benchmark against any of the provided json files:

``` text
$ docker run -it mujson-bench:py3 1000 apache.json
