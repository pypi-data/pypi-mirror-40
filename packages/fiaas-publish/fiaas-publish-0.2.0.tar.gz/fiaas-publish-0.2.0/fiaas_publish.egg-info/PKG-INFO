        publish is a tool to package and release a python project. It will create a changelog and upload artifacts to Github and PyPI.
        
        It is created for and by the `FIAAS project`_, and used for most of our projects.

        Usage
        -----
        
        In order to use publish, you must first install it::
        
            pip install publish
        
        
        Under the covers, publish uses github-release_ and twine_ to do most of the work, and those tools require credentials for Github and PyPI to be available in environment variables::
        
            export GITHUB_TOKEN=gh-token
            export TWINE_USERNAME=pypi-user
            export TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-pass
        
        In order to know where to upload the artifacts, you must specify an organization, and a repository::
        
            publish fiaas k8s
        
        
        Before uploading anything, publish will verify that the current checkout is suitable to be released, and checks the following items:
        
        * Are all files either ignored or in version control?
        * Is every change committed?
        * Is the currently checked out code tagged with an annotated tag?
        * Does that tag use the convention ``v<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>``?
        
        If the answer to all of these is yes, the name of the tag is used as the version to release. A changelog is generated from the git log, source tarballs and wheels are built, the release is created in Github and PyPI, and the files are uploaded.
