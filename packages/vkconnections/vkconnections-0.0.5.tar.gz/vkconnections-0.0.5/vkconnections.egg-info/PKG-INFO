Description: # Vk Connections: the shortest path from one vk user to another
        Library that finds the shortest path from one vk user to another through friends.
        ## VkConnection classes
        `class Create(keys)`
        
        Parametrs:
        - keys - list of 4 Vk api keys (user or community access)
        
        Note that keys is a list with exactly 4 api keys, this requires fast work of library (each request being processed under 30 sec)
        
        ## Methods of Create class
        
        `getConnection(userFrom, userTo)`
        
        Parameters:
        - userFrom вЂ“ id/nickname/link to user A
        - userTo вЂ“ id/nickname/link to user B
        
        Result:
        A list of lists of dictionaries {id: person_id, full_name: person_full_name, photo: person_photo}
        
        `printResult(result)` - prints the result from main method
        
        ## Installation
        `pip install vkconnections`
        
        ## Example
        ```python
        import vkconnections
        
        # Vk API Keys
        firstKey = 'XXX'
        secondKey = 'XXX'
        thirdKey = 'XXX'
        fourthKey = 'XXX'
        
        keys = [firstKey, secondKey, thirdKey, fourthKey]  # all the keys in one list
        
        vk = vkconnections.Create(keys)  # creating an instance of a class
        
        # users for making a way
        userFrom = "alsu"
        userTo = "dm"
        
        result = vk.getConnection(userFrom, userTo)  # receiving a result
        vk.printConnection(result)  # printing result
        ```
        Output:
        ```
        
        
        ```
