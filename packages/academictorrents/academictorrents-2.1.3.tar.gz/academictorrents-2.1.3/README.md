# Academic Torrents Python API

The idea of this API is to allow scripts to download datasets easily. The library should be available on every system and allow a simple interface to download small and large files.

We are currently out on pip! Install AT with this command:
```pip install academictorrents```


```
import academictorrents as at

# Download the data (or verify existing data)
filename = at.get("323a0048d87ca79b68f12a6350a57776b6a3b7fb")

# Then work with the data
import cPickle, gzip
import sys, os, time
import numpy as np

mnist = gzip.open(filename, 'rb')
train_set, validation_set, test_set = cPickle.load(mnist)
mnist.close()
```
More documentation will be released soon!
