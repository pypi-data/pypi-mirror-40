Description: # Academic Torrents Python API
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AcademicTorrents/at-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AcademicTorrents/at-python)
        [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AcademicTorrents/at-python/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/AcademicTorrents/python-r-api)
        
        The idea of this API is to allow scripts to download datasets easily. The library should be available on every system and allow a simple interface to download small and large files.
        
        We are currently out on pip! Install AT with this command:
        ```pip install academictorrents```
        
        
        ```
        import academictorrents as at
        
        # Download the data (or verify existing data)
        filename = at.get("323a0048d87ca79b68f12a6350a57776b6a3b7fb")
        
        # Then work with the data
        import cPickle, gzip
        import sys, os, time
        import numpy as np
        
        mnist = gzip.open(filename, 'rb')
        train_set, validation_set, test_set = cPickle.load(mnist)
        mnist.close()
        ```
        More documentation will be released soon!
