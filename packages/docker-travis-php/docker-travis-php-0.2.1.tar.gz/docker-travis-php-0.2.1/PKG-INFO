        =================
        
        Shits out a simple dockerfile for php projects based upon a .travis.yml
        
        Literally don't use this and assume it'll work. It probably won't. Hence the description.
        
        Literally the worst. I can't even.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using PIP via PyPI::
        
            pip install docker-travis-php
        
        Using PIP via Github::
        
            pip install git+git://github.com/josegonzalez/docker-travis-php.git#egg=docker-travis-php
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        In a directory with a ``.travis.yml``, run the following:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            docker-travis-php
        
        You will now have a ``Dockerfile`` in that directory that can be run via the following command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # builds the ``before_script`` and ``script`` sections
            # useful for "local" travis runs
            docker build .
        
        The default debian packages that are installed (before php extensions) are as follows:
        
        - ``git-core``
        - ``libcurl4-openssl-dev``
        - ``libicu-dev``
        - ``php-pear``
        - ``php5-cli``
        
        You can add more by using the following environment variable:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            export PACKAGES=wget
            docker-travis-php
        
        By default, the following extensions are built:
        
        - ``curl``
        - ``intl``
        - ``mbstring``
        - ``mysql``
        - ``redis``
        - ``xdebug``
        
        You can configure this using the following environment variable:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            export EXTENSIONS=curl,intl,mbstring
            docker-travis-php
