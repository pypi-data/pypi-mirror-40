Setup
-----

Step 1
~~~~~~

In your models.py add the field ``comments`` (Please note that field name
must be ``comments`` not ``comment``) to the model for which comments
should be added (e.g. Post) and **the appropriate imports** as shown below:

.. code:: python

    from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericRelation
    from comment.models import Comment

    class Post(models.Model):
        author = models.ForeignKey(User)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        body = models.TextField()
        # the field name should be comments
        comments = GenericRelation(Comment)

Step 2
~~~~~~

``get_comments`` *tag uses 2 positional and 3 optional args*:

    1. The instance of the model. (**positional**)
    2. Request object. (**positional**)
    3. oauth. (optional - Default is false)
    4. paginate. (optional - Default is false)
    5. cpp (number of Comments Per Page - Default is 10)


1. Basics usage:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``include_static`` this tag will include required jquery and javascript file,
if you already use jquery please make sure it is not the slim version which doesn't support ajax.
``include_bootstrap`` tag is for bootstrap-4.1.1, if itâ€™s already included
in your project, get rid of this tag.

In your template (e.g. post-detail.html) add the following template tags where object is the instance of post model.

.. code:: python

    {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag
    {% get_comments object request %}  # Include all the comments belonging to a certain object


**Include static files:**

The comment app has three template tags for static files that the app requires.
These tags need to be included in the end of your base template.


- **Case 1:** You already have jQuey in your project then the following tags shall be included below jQuery file:

.. code:: html

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.js"></script>

    {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag

    {% include_static %}  # Include comment.js file only.
    {% include_bootstrap %}  # Include bootstrap 4.1.1 - remove this line if BS 4.1.1 is already used in your project


- **Case 2:** You don't have jQuery in your project then the following tags shall be included:

.. code:: html

    {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag

    {% include_static_jquery %}  # Include mini jQuery 3.2.1 and required js file.
    {% include_bootstrap %}  # Include bootstrap 4.1.1 - remove this line if BS 4.1.1 is already used in your project


2. Advanced usage:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    **1. Add pagination:**

    To add pagination to your comments, you need to pass two variables to the ``get_comments`` tag.
    ``paginate`` must be set to ``True`` and set ``cpp`` var (number of comments per page - default is 10) to the desired number of comments per page.
    e.g. If you would like to have 5 comments per page, the ``get_comments`` tag should look like this:

    .. code:: python

        {% load comment_tags %}  # Loading the template tag
        {% get_comments object request paginate=True cpp=5 %}  # Include all the comments belonging to a certain object
        {% include_bootstrap %} # Include bootstrap 4.1.1 - remove this line if BS 4.1.1 is already used in your project
        {% include_static %} # Include jQuery 3.2.1 and required js file



    **2. Integrate existing profile app with comments app:**

    If you have a profile model for the user and you would like to show the
    profile image on each comment, you need to do these two steps:

    - Declare ``PROFILE_APP_NAME`` and ``PROFILE_MODEL_NAME`` variables in your ``settings.py`` file.
        (e.g if user profile app is called ``accounts`` and profile model is called ``UserProfile``)
        Update your ``settings.py`` as follows:

        .. code:: python

            PROFILE_APP_NAME = 'accounts'
            PROFILE_MODEL_NAME = 'UserProfile' # letter case insensitive



    - Make sure that ``get_absolute_url`` method is defined in your profile model.
        Update your ``user profile model`` as follows:

        .. code:: python

            from django.urls import reverse

            class UserProfile(models.Model):
                user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
                ...
                ...

                # this method must be defined for appropriate url mapping in comments section
                def get_absolute_url(self):
                    return reverse('profile_url_name')
