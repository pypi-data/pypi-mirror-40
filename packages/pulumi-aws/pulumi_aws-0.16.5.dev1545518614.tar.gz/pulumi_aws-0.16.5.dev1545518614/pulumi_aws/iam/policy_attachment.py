    Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to user(s), role(s), and/or group(s)
    
    !> **WARNING:** The aws_iam_policy_attachment resource creates **exclusive** attachments of IAM policies. Across the entire AWS account, all of the users/roles/groups to which a single policy is attached must be declared by a single aws_iam_policy_attachment resource. This means that even any users/roles/groups that have the attached policy via any other mechanism (including other Terraform resources) will have that attached policy revoked by this resource. Consider `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`, `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment`, or `aws_iam_group_policy_attachment` instead. These resources do not enforce exclusive attachment of an IAM policy.
    
    ~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `aws_iam_group_policy_attachment`, `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`, and `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment` resources and will permanently show a difference if both are defined.
