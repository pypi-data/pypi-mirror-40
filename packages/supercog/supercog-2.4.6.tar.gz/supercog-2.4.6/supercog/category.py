"""
This is a file that contains a single class for the Category object.

A Category object includes options for an extension in a Discord Bot
Useful functions include:
    * Markdown
    * HTML
    * Server Category
    * NSFW Category
    * and many more.

The Markdown function will automatically generate Markdown text to layout the contents of
the Category you call it on. Each Category will be given the following format:

    Category Name
    Category Description
    Category Restriction Information (if any)
    Whether or not the Category can only be run in a Server.
    Whether or not the Category can only be run in an NSFW channel (or private channel).
    The list of Commands

The HTML function will follow the same format but it generates HTML code instead.

Both functions have linking included as to simplify a Table of Contents in the entire bot you generate.

        Note: The default function will return a simple error message saying \"This command is globally inactive right now.\"


    The `locally_active_check` is a function that checks if a `Command` is active in a Server.
        If providing a custom function, you must give the Discord Server and Command to check
        Note: The default function will return True.

    The `globally_active_check` is a function the checks if a `Command` is active throughout the Bot.
        If providing a custom function, you must give the Command to check.
        Note: The default function will return True.
              If a Bot Moderator runs the command, it will run normally as to easily test it.

              The default bot_mod_check function is a coroutine. However, you do NOT need to specify
                a coroutine to run the bot_mod_check function. You can also specify a synchronous function.
    
    The `testing_server_id` is the ID of the Discord Server you use to test your bot (if you have one).
        Note: The Bot must be in the server for it to work.
