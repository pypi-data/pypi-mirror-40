The SNMP Proxy Forwarder tool works as an application-level proxy with a built-in
SNMP message router. SNMP forwarder design features split client/server operation
that promotes having one part of the system in DMZ while other part is 
facing the Internet. Message routing can be programmed via a declarative
mini-language.

Typical use case for an SNMP proxy is to work as an application-level firewall
or a protocol translator that enables SNMPv3 access to a SNMPv1/SNMPv2c
entity or vice versa.

First you need to configure the tool. It is largely driven by
[configuration files](http://snmplabs.com/snmpfwd/configuration/index.html)
written in a declarative mini-language. To help you started, we maintain
[a collection](http://snmplabs.com/snmpfwd/configuration/index.html#examples)
of configuration files designed to serve specific use-cases.
