Description: # Repeat Queries
        
        
        Smart Queries is a django package which helps django developer to avoid the N+1 queries issue by recording it and keeping a track of it per request.
        
        
        ### Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "repeat_queries" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
            ```
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'repeat_queries',
            ]
            ```
        2. Add 'repeat_queries.middleware.DuplicateQueryMiddleware', to your MIDDLEWARE settings like this ::
            ```
            MIDDLEWARE = [
                ...,
                'repeat_queries.middleware.DuplicateQueryMiddleware',
            ]
            ```
        
        2. Include the repeat_queries URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
            For Django version > 2.0
            ```
            path('repeat_queries/', include('repeat_queries.urls')),
            ```
            For earlier versions
            ```
            url(r'^repeat_queries/', include('repeat_queries.urls')),
            ```
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the repeat_queries models.
        
        4. Start the development server, Hit any endpoint/view and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to see your data.
