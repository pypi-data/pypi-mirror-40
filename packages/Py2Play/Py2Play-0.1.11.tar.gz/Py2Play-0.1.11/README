Py2Play

WARNING !!!
DUE TO SECURITY PROBLEM, NETWORK SUPPORT HAS BEEN DISABLED.



Py2Play  is a peer-to-peer network game engine -- It means that no
server is needed to play. Only (identical) clients are used !

A small demo is included.

To play on a single local computer, launch ./startdemo_local1 for the
first player, THEN ./startdemo_local2 and ./startdemo_local3 for the
following.

To play on a real network, use the ./startdemo script as following:
 - ./startdemo --name your_name
       to create a new game

 - ./startdemo --name your_name --parrain host
       to join a game played by someone at "host" (IP address or host
name). "host" can be the host of any player; not necessarily the first
one (the one which as initiated the game).

There is also options for changing the default port's address.

In the demo, character are represented by letter (the first letter of
your name), and the "#" is a NPC (a "monster") played by the
computer.
You can use the cursor keys to move around, and the space key to
create a block at your position. To go to another level, just move out
of the screen.

There is currently no real goal in this demo game; it is just here for
testing purpose.


Distribution uses the Python distutils tools.
Install it with (as root):

  cd Py2Play-XXX
  python ./setup.py install
