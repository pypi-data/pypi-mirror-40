# plottingtools
A collection of tools that I use for plotting often enough (or with enough
complexity) to necessitate creating a useful API.


## Overview
This package is intended to
make plotting as easy as possible for simple data science visualizations. It's
essentially a wrapper around matplotlib and is designed to simplify the process
of creating quick plots. While it's certainly not as powerful as using
matplotlib directly, it hopefully makes it a lot easier to display information
quickly.

This package does not rely on (or currently support) pandas `DataFrames`, and
expects data to be in vector form (ideally a numpy `ndarray`). 


## Functionality
Currently, this package does the following:
- Display data as distinctly-colored bars on a single plot


## Installation
` pip install plottingtools `


## Updates and contribution
Keep your eyes here to see updates. Please submit issues or PRs as you see fit.
