# Robovision

Vision processing scripts useful for FIRST robotics teams and probably other purposes.

## Overview

The robovision library includes these functions:

* image resizing, either proportionally (maintaining aspect ratio) or to a fixed/square size
* image equalization
* brightness and contrast adjustments
* a preprocessor class, which enables you to set up a pipeline of functions that will be applied in series to an image.
* edge detection
* removing lens distortions based on the camera calibrations created with autocalibrate.py

Separately, the autocalibrate script is a camera calibration utility, which uses the OpenCV chessboard technique to determine lens parameters to be used for dewarping operations.
