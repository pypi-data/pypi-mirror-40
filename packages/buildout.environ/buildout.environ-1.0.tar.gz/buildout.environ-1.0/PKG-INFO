        Install ``buildout.environ`` by adding it to your buildout extensions::

        Usage
        -----
        
        Use ``${__environ__:VARIABLENAME}`` to address any environment variable.
        
        Example::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.environ
            parts = print
        
            [print]
            recipe = mr.scripty
            install =
                print("Found in environ: PATH=${__environ__:PATH}")
