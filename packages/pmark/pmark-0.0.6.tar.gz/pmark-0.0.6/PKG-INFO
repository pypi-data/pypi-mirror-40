        =====
        
        python benchmarking utility
        
        Requirements
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        1. **OS:** macOS Maverics+ or Ubuntu 14.04+
        2. **Python:** v3.6.0+
        3. **Tensorflow:** v1.4.0+
        
        What is pmark?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Pmark - “Python Benchmark” is a simple yet intutive process monitoring
        tool, which can monitor, 1. CPU Usage 2. RAM Usage 3. GPU Usage
        (Supports only NVidia for now)
        
        Architecture:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

           Architecture
        
        1. A function with required arguments is sent to the utility.
        2. The function is sent as a target for a python Process, which shares
           statistics using a BaseManager.
        3. Required Monitors (CPU/GPU/RAM) are attached to the current process
           as threads.
        4. The attached monitors are given the main process ``pid`` which helps
           us in extracting consumption of resources by the process, thereby
           increasing the accuracy of monitoring process.
        5. Each of the monitors supports interval configuration which can be
           overridden by benchmark interval.
        6. The threads for each monitor continues to run, untill main process is
           completed, once done, all the threads, including the main process are
           closed.
