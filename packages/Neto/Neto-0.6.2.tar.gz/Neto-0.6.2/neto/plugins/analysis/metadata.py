    Method that runs an analysis

    This method is dinamically loaded by neto.lib.extensions.Extension objects
    to conduct an analysis. The analyst can choose to perform the analysis on
    kwargs["extensionFile"] or on kwargs["unzippedFiles"]. It SHOULD return a
    dictionary with the results of the analysis that will be updated to the
    features property of the Extension.

    Args:
    -----
        kwargs: It currently contain:
            - extensionFile: A string to the local path of the extension.
            - unzippedFiles: A dictionary where the key is the relative path to
                the file and the the value the absolute path to the extension.
                {
                    "manifest.json": "/tmp/extension/manifest.json"
                    â€¦
                }
    Returns:
    --------
        A dictionary where the key is the name given to the analysis and the
            value is the result of the analysis. This result can be of any
            format.
