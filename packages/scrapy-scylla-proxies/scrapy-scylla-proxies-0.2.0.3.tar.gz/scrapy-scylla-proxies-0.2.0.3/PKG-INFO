Description: # Random proxy middleware for [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/)
        
        ### Using [Scylla](https://github.com/imWildCat/scylla) to fetch valid proxies.
        
        <hr>
        
        NOTE: I am not a real programmer, help always appreciated! But it works!
        
        Processes Scrapy requests using a random proxy from list to avoid IP ban and
        improve crawling speed, this plugs in to the Scylla project which provides a local database of proxies.
        
        ## Install Scylla
        
        The Scylla project will need to be set-up separately!! The quickest way to do this is to use the docker container. The following command will download and run Scylla (provided you have docker installed of course)
        
            docker run -d -p 8899:8899 -p 8081:8081 --name scylla wildcat/scylla:latest
        
        ## Install scrapy-scylla-proxies
        
        The quick way:
        
            pip install scrapy-scylla-proxies
        
        Or checkout the source and run
        
            python setup.py install
        
        ## What to put in Scrapy's 'settings.py'
        
        This is stuff you are going to need to integrate this middleware with scrapy.
        
        SSP_SCYLLA_URI - The location of the Scylla API (Default: 'http://localhost:8899')
        
        SSP_PROXY_TIMEOUT - How often the proxy list is refreshed (Default: 60s)
        
        SSP_HTTPS - Whether to only use HTTPS proxies, You will need this set to True if you are scraping an HTTPS site (Default: True)
        
        ### Example
        
            # Retry many times since proxies often fail
            RETRY_TIMES = 10
            # Retry on most error codes since proxies fail for different reasons
            RETRY_HTTP_CODES = [500, 503, 504, 400, 403, 404, 408]
        
            DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
                # For retries
                'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.retry.RetryMiddleware': 290,
                # For random scylla proxies
                'scrapy_scylla_proxies.RandomProxy': 300,
                # For http proxy ip rotation
                'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware': 310,
            }
        
            # Location of the scylla server
            SSP_SCYLLA_URI = 'http://localhost:8899'
            # Proxy timeout in seconds
            SSP_PROXY_TIMEOUT = 90
            # Get only https proxies
            SSP_HTTPS = True
