Parse [indicators of compromise](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Indicators-of-Compromise-IOC) from text.

## Capabilities

Currently, this package can the following items in a given text:

- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Email addresses (both standard format (e.g. `test@example.com`) and an email with an IP address as the domain (e.g. `test@[192.168.0.1]`))
- Domain names (support for Unicode domain names (e.g. `È©xample.com`) is coming soon)
- URLs
- File hashes (md5, sha1, sha256, and sha512)
- Registry Key paths (e.g. `"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows`)
- Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) (in multiple formats such as `asn1234` and `as 1234`)
- CVEs (e.g. `CVE-2014-1234`)
- CIDR ranges (currently ipv4 ranges; ipv6 ranges coming soon)
- Others... if you have any requests, [let me know](https://github.com/fhightower/ioc-finder) (or you can contact me [here](https://hightower.space/contact/) to make private suggestions)!

Also provides some helpful features like:

- Ability to remove an indicator type after it is parsed - For example, if you would like to parse all URLs, but do not want to parse the domain name from each URL, you specify this.
