        # Slick
        
        **Easy to use secure file sending**
        
        Slick makes it easy to send files or chat between two people. It is end-to-end encrypted, and uses HTTPS as its transport.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Using python 3.7, run:
        
        `pip install slick-app`
        
        ## Usage
        
        To start slick, run `sk`. Running `/help` you'll get:
        
        ```
        /list           -- show active friends and nearby people
        /add  [subject] -- add a person
        /talk [subject] -- talk to someone
        /end            -- stop talking to someone
        /quit           -- quit the program
        /send           -- send a file
        /get            -- get a file
        /info
        ```
        
        ### Adding a friend
        
        To add a friend, use the `/add` command. They will need to approve the request on their side by adding you back.
        
        ### Interacting with a friend
        
        To interact with a specific friend, use `/talk [name]`
        
        ### Chatting
        
        Once you're interacting with a friend, anything you type without a leading slash will be interpretted as chatting.
        
        ### Sending a file
        
        To send a file, use `/send`
        
        ### Receiving a file
        
        To receive a file, use `/get #`
        
        ## Design
        
        Slick uses multicast DNS to broadcast a) a digest of the certificate used by HTTPS b) a tor service to facilitate the initial key exchange.
