\section howto How to use this documentation

This documentation describes the C++ API of the SimpleITK interface
to the Insight Toolkit. The wrapped languages have a very simular
interface, that should only be trivially different.  The
Related Pages link presents interface conventions, user and
developer information. Additionally the Example tab provides a
variety of example of SimpleITK with different language bindings.
