This project is a GUI (graphical user interface) application for controlling the Automated Drink
Dispensing System, which dispenses drinks from a set menu. The source code was built to run on a
Raspberry Pi 3 computer with the Raspbian OS, but it should be fairly compatible with other
environments.

The GUI source code heavily relies on the Tkinter API for the Tk widget toolkit and other common
Python libraries. The source code mainly deals with file IO, GUI management, and serial communication
to peripheral devices.

Note:
This package requires pil.ImageTk.
