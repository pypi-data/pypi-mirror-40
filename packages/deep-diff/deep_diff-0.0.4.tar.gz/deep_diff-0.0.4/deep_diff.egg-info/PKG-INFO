        # USAGE
        ```
        pip install deep_diff
        from deep_diff import diff
        diff({'a':1},{'b':1})
        ```
        ``` json
        [ { kind: 'E',
            path: [ 'name' ],
            lhs: 'my object',
            rhs: 'updated object' },
          { kind: 'E',
            path: [ 'details', 'with', 2 ],
            lhs: 'elements',
            rhs: 'more' },
          { kind: 'A',
            path: [ 'details', 'with' ],
            index: 3,
            item: { kind: 'N', rhs: 'elements' } },
          { kind: 'A',
            path: [ 'details', 'with' ],
            index: 4,
            item: { kind: 'N', rhs: { than: 'before' } } } ]
        ```
        
        ### Differences
        
        Differences are reported as one or more change records. Change records have the following structure:
        
        * `kind` - indicates the kind of change; will be one of the following:
          * `N` - indicates a newly added property/element
          * `D` - indicates a property/element was deleted
          * `E` - indicates a property/element was edited
          * `A` - indicates a change occurred within an array
        * `path` - the property path (from the left-hand-side root)
        * `lhs` - the value on the left-hand-side of the comparison (undefined if kind == 'N')
        * `rhs` - the value on the right-hand-side of the comparison (undefined if kind == 'D')
        * `index` - when kind == 'A', indicates the array index where the change occurred
        * `item` - when kind == 'A', contains a nested change record indicating the change that occurred at the array index
