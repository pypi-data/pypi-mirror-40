    rhs: 'updated object' },
  { kind: 'E',
    path: [ 'details', 'with', 2 ],
    lhs: 'elements',

### Differences

Differences are reported as one or more change records. Change records have the following structure:

* `kind` - indicates the kind of change; will be one of the following:
  * `N` - indicates a newly added property/element
  * `D` - indicates a property/element was deleted
  * `E` - indicates a property/element was edited
  * `A` - indicates a change occurred within an array
* `path` - the property path (from the left-hand-side root)
* `lhs` - the value on the left-hand-side of the comparison (undefined if kind == 'N')
* `rhs` - the value on the right-hand-side of the comparison (undefined if kind == 'D')
* `index` - when kind == 'A', indicates the array index where the change occurred
* `item` - when kind == 'A', contains a nested change record indicating the change that occurred at the array index
