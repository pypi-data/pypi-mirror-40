Description: KDL Wagtail Page
        ================
        
        Very basic but reusable Wagtail page models for KDL projects.
        The idea is to have a single code base for our Wagtail components.
        
        => we can just install and use, no coding necessary for simple use cases
        
        => we don't have to maintain and upgrade a lot of small variants of the same
        code which was copied and adapted for each project
        
        For contributors:
        
        * runs out of the box with minimal settings
        * keep it generic and relatively simple (code and interface)
        * if you need something more advanced (but reusable), create a new page type
        * if you need something very specific: subclass into your own project
        * keep it focused, it is a package about pages (not menus, search or blogs)
        * keep it backward-compatible
        * automate the upgrades
        * keep it compatible with wagtail and Django 2
        * keep it compatible with barebones base.html template blocks
