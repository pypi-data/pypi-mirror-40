        ## About
        
        This package provides a class for parsing PLS-CADD XML files to `pandas`
        data frames for manipulation with Python.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package may be installed via `pip` by running the below command:
        
        ```
        pip install plsxml
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once installed, data may be loaded from XML files or ZIP files containing XML
        simply by passing the XML and/or ZIP paths to the `PLSXML` class.
        
        ```
        from plsxml import PLSXML
        paths = ['folder1/xml_file.xml', 'folder2/zip_file.zip']
        plsxml = PLSXML(paths)
        ```
        
        The data will be loaded into various `pandas.DataFrame` based on the XML file
        table names and assigned to the class. For more detailed information, see the
        [example notebook](https://github.com/mpewsey/plsxml/blob/master/example.ipynb).
        
        ## PLS-CADD XML Files
        
        Most reports in the PLS-CADD suite can be exported to XML by right-clicking and
        selecting the export to XML option. It is also possible to export an XML file
        containing data for an entire line through the File menu. XML files for an
        entire line can be large (several GB); therefore, archiving the resulting XML
        to ZIP can greatly aid in transferring the file across systems and save disk
        space if the file is more permanently retained. The PLSXML package is also able
        to read data directly from ZIP files for this reason.
