        Catch unsafe SQL migrations.
        
        .. code:: console
        
          $ squabble sql/migration.sql
          sql/migration.sql:4:46 ERROR: column "uh_oh" has a disallowed constraint [1004]
          ALTER TABLE big_table ADD COLUMN uh_oh integer DEFAULT 0;
                                                         ^
          # Use --explain to get more information on a lint violation
          $ squabble --explain 1004
          ConstraintNotAllowed
               When adding a column to an existing table, certain constraints can have
               unintentional side effects, like locking the table or introducing
               performance issues.
               ...
        
        Squabble works to help automate the process of reviewing SQL migrations
        by catching simple mistakes, such as:
        
        -  Changing the type of an existing column
        -  Adding a new column with a default value or ``NOT NULL`` constraint
        -  Building an index without using ``CONCURRENTLY``
        
        For more information on why these particular cases can be dangerous:

        -  https://stripe.com/blog/online-migrations
        
        Currently, most of the rules have been focused on Postgres and its
        quirks. However, squabble can parse any ANSI SQL and new rules that are
        specific to other databases are appreciated!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ pip3 install squabble
           $ squabble --help
        
        .. note::
        
           Squabble is only supported on Python 3.5+
        
        If you’d like to install from source:
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ git clone https://github.com/erik/squabble.git && cd squabble
           $ python3 -m venv ve && source ve/bin/activate
           $ python setup.py install
           $ squabble --help
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        To see a list of rules, try
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ squabble --list-rules
        
        Then, to show more verbose information about a rule (such as rationale
        and configuration options)
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ squabble --show-rule AddColumnsDisallowConstraints
        
        Once a configuration file is in place, it can be passed explicitly on
        the command line, or automatically looked up.
        
        .. code:: console
        
           $ squabble -c path/to/config ...
        
        If not explicitly given on the command line, squabble will look for a
        file named ``.squabblerc`` in the following places (in order):
        
        -  ``./.squabblerc``
        -  ``(git_repo_root)/.squabblerc``
        -  ``~/.squabblerc``
        
        Example Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: json
        
           {
             "reporter": "color",
        
             "plugins": [
               "/some/directory/with/custom/rules"
             ],
        
             "rules": {
               "AddColumnsDisallowConstraints": {
                 "disallowed": ["DEFAULT", "FOREIGN", "NOT NULL"]
               }
             }
           }

        This project would not be possible without:
        
        -  `libpg_query <https://github.com/lfittl/libpg_query>`__ - Postgres
           query parser
        -  `pglast <https://github.com/lelit/pglast>`__ - Python bindings to
           libpg_query
        -  Postgres - …obviously
