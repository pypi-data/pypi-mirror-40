Synopsis
========

::

    placement-manage <category> <action>

Description
===========

:program:`placement-manage` is used to perform administrative tasks with the
placement service. It is designed for use by operators and deployers.

Options
=======

The standard pattern for executing a ``placement-manage`` command is::

  placement-manage  [-h] [--config-dir DIR] [--config-file PATH]
                    <category> <command> [<args>]

Run without arguments to see a list of available command categories::

  placement-manage

You can also run with a category argument such as ``db`` to see a list of all
commands in that category::

  placement-manage db

Configuration options (for example the ``[placement_database]/connection``
URL) are by default found in a file at ``/etc/placement/placement.conf``. The
``config-dir`` and ``config-file`` arguments may be used to select a different
file.

The following sections describe the available categories and arguments for
placement-manage.

Placement Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``placement-manage db version``
    Print the current database version.

``placement-manage db sync``
    Upgrade the database schema to the most recent version.  The local database
    connection is determined by ``[placement_database]/connection`` in the
    configuration file used by placement-manage. If the ``connection`` option
    is not set, the command will fail. The defined database must already exist.

``placement-manage db stamp <version>``
    Stamp the revision table with the given revision; donâ€™t run any migrations.
    This can be used when the database already exists and you want to bring it
    under alembic control.
