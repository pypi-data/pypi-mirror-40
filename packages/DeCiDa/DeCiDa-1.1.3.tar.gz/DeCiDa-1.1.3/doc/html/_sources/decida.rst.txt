**DeCiDa Data Analysis and Procedural Simulation Python Library**
=================================================================

DeCiDa == Device and Circuit Data Analysis.
`DeCiDa man pages <http://www.decida.org/PyDeCiDa_man_pages>`_

DeCiDa is a Python Library of functions and classes for
device characterization, circuit design and data analysis.

DeCida is written in pure Python (2.7, and 3), and requires no code-compilation.
It is portable to any operating system where Python is installed, and runs
under MacOS, Windows, Cygwin, and Linux.  Many DeCiDa classes and functions
require the numpy and Tkinter packages.

This version of DeCiDa provides support for Python 3 and can be run under
a Python 3 environment, as well as a Python 2.7 environment.
The following packages are now required: future, six, numpy and matplotlib.
Please let me know if there are any issues that you find.

DeCiDa uses matplotlib XY-plot rendering by default.
To use the former XY-plot rendering, add the option -xmat
to dataview, plotter, pllss, and pll_phase_noise.

For circuit analysis, DeCiDa provides a flexible scripting class for
performing simulations with various circuit simulation tools, such as
(Synopsys) HSpice, (Cadence) Spectre, (Silvaco) SmartSpice,
(UC Berkeley) NGspice and others.
The Tckt class is used to provide a database of process corners for
each project, and to provide netlist templating for performing procedural
simulations and post-processing.
Scripts using Tckt access the database to obtain
the corner conditions, modify the netlist, and allow full Python looping
structures for running the simulation, viewing and analyzing
the simulated data.

For data analysis, DeCiDa provides a Data class for reading-in and 
analyzing data in a number of formats, including nutmeg
(NGspice, Spectre, LTspice), CSDF (HSpice), CSV (comma-separated value),
SSV (space-separated value), and others.
The Data object can be viewed using the XYplotm, Histogramx or DataViewm
classes.
DataViewm has commands via menu entries to manipulate and plot the data in
different ways, including frequency versus time, eye- and scope-diagrams
and column calculations.

DeCiDa started out as a Tcl/Tk application for analyzing measurements
of electron devices for performing routine compact-model parameter extraction.
To do this fitting, a least-squares optimization algorithm was used.
This Python version of DeCiDa has a function LevMar (for Levenberg-Marquardt),
based on the mpfit package.  It is still under development.

Known Problems
--------------

* FrameNotebook: (test_FrameNotebook_2)

  XYplotm window doesn't display at first

  solution: frame_notebook.lift_tab(tab_name), shown in the test

* LevMar:

  still under development

* MatPlotLib rendering (dataview and plotter):

  may run out of memory when plotting with many flyback line removals.

  solution: use dataview or plotter with -xmat option (old plotting routine)

* If plotting on Macbook screen in multiple-monitor environment, the
  window may shrink to a small size.

  solution: make another monitor the primary screen.
