    Definition. Let X be a continuous random variable with generic probability density function
     (x) defined over the support v(low) <= x < v(high). And, let Y = u(X) be an invertible function of X
     with inverse function X = v(Y). Then, using the change-of-variable technique,*
     the probability density function of Y is:

    fY(y) = fX(v(y)) × |v′(y)|

    defined over the support low <= y < high.

    here y = base ** x
         x = ln(y) / ln(base)
    fX(x) = 1 / (v(high) - v(low))

    fY(y) = (1 / (v(high) - v(low))) * (1 / (y * np.log(base))
    for low <= y < high

    Visual proof:

    low = 1
    high = 3
    base = 10
    size = 1000000
    samples = generate_samples_loguniform(low=low, high=high, step=None, base=base, size=size)
