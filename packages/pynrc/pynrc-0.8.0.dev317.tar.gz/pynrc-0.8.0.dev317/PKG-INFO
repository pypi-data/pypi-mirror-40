        pyNRC is a set of Python-based tools for planning observations with JWST NIRCam, 
        such as an ETC, a simple image slope simulator, and an enhanced data simulator.
        
        While special attention has been placed on NIRCam coronagraphic modes, 
        this package also works for a variety of NIRCam observing modes including:
        
        - direct imaging 
        - coronagraphic imaging
        - weak lens imaging
        - slitless grism spectroscopy
        - DHS observations (TBI)
        
        All PSFs are generated via WebbPSF (https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io) to reproduce 
        realistic JWST images and spectra.
        
        Documentation can be found at https://pynrc.readthedocs.io.
        
        **Note:** pyNRC enables more modes than are officially allowed by the Observatory,
        (ie., filter + coronagraphic combinations, subarray sizes, etc.). 
        Just because you can do something with pyNRC does not mean it will be supported.
        Check out https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/display/JTI/NIRCam+Observing+Modes for more information.
        
        Similar to some of its dependencies, pyNRC requires a host of input data files in
        order to generate simulations. Due to the size of these files, they are not included
        with this source distribution. Please see the documentation for instructions on how to
        to download the required data files.

        - Detector pixel timing bugs
        
        v0.7.0 (Jun 2018)
        -----------------
        
        - Did not make it out of development before WebbPSF 0.8.0 release.
        - Works with WebbPSF 0.7.0.
        
          - Field-dependent WFE
          - Image plane distortions
        
        - Implemented ``jwst_backgrounds`` (not required)
        
        
        v0.6.5 (Mar 2018)
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed a critical bug where the off-axis PSF size was incorrect
          when performing WFE drift calculations.
        
        v0.6.4 (Mar 2018)
        -----------------
        
        - Off-axis PSFs now get drifted in the same way as their on-axis
          counterparts.
        - Created an intermediate :mod:`~pynrc.nrc_hci` class to enable
          offsets of WFE drifted PSFs.
        
        
        v0.6.3 (Mar 2018)
        -----------------
        
        - First PyPI release.
        - Effectively the same as 0.6.2, but better documentation of packaging and distributing.
        
        
        v0.6.2 (Mar 2018)
        -----------------
        
        - Implemented coronagraphic wedges, including arbitrary offsets along bar
        - Renamed ``obs_coronagraphy`` to :mod:`~pynrc.obs_hci`
        
          - Faster modeling of off-axis PSFs
          - Include coronagraphic features (e.g.: ND squares) in slope images
          - Roll subtracted images include option to use Roll1-Roll2
          - Fixed bug that was slowing down PSF convolution of disks
        
        - Can now generate docs directly from Jupyter notebooks using nbsphinx extension
        - Coronagraphic tutorials for docs
        - Create the ``source_spectrum`` class to fit spectra to observed photometry.
        
        v0.6.0 (Dec 2017)
        -----------------
        
        - Support for Python 3 (mostly ``map``, ``dict``, and index fixes)
        - Updated code comments for ``sphinx`` and ``readthedocs`` documentation
        - Create ``setup.py`` install file
        - Modify grism PSF shapes due to aperture shape
        - Detector frames times based on ASIC microcode build 10
        - Headers for DMS data
        - Three major changes to PSF coefficients
        
          - coefficients based on module (SWA, SWB, LWA, LWB), rather than filter
          - WFE drift coefficient relations
          - field-dependent coefficient relation
