        This program was created for demonstration and partial automation of Komodo GatewaysCC stack testing. (AssetsCC, OraclesCC, GatewaysCC, oraclesfeed dAPP)
        
        Python3 required for execution:
        *  `sudo apt-get install python3.6`
        pip packages needed:
        * `pip3 install setuptools wheel slick-bitcoinrpc`
        * or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
        Before execution be sure than daemon for needed AC up.
        
        At the moment raw version of manual gateway how-to guide can be found here: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/gateways/scenarios/tutorial.html I advice to read it before you start use this tool to understand the flow.
