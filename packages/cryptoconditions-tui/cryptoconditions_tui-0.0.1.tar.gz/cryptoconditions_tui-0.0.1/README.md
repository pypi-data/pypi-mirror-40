# GatewaysCC Terminal User Interface

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/c8DPfpp.png)

This program was created for demonstration and partial automation of Komodo GatewaysCC stack testing. (AssetsCC, OraclesCC, GatewaysCC, oraclesfeed dAPP)

Python3 required for execution:
*  `sudo apt-get install python3.6`
pip packages needed:
* `pip3 install setuptools wheel slick-bitcoinrpc`
* or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
Before execution be sure than daemon for needed AC up.

At the moment raw version of manual gateway how-to guide can be found here: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/gateways/scenarios/tutorial.html I advice to read it before you start use this tool to understand the flow.
