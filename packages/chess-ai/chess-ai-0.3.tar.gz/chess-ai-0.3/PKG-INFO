        # Very Quick Tutorial
        
        To construct a new chess board, use the Board class.
        
            >>> board = Board();
        
        To show the board, print board.
        
            >>> print(board)
        
        To locate a position, use locate().
        
            >>> locate("a3")
            a3
        
        To get a piece, call the get_piece method.
        
            >>> board.get_piece(locate("a1"))
            Rook("white") at a1
