Description: kutils
        ======
        
        Kyle's utilities.
        
        These are various data structures and tools that I think are useful and
        want to re-use across projects.
        
        A Makefile is supplied to simplify certain tasks. This is aimed to
        support *the author's* workflow, and may not be as useful to other
        people.
        
        + ``build``: create a source distribution.
        + ``clean``: remove caches, compiled bytecode, build artifacts, and
          any generated documentation.
        + ``docs``: generate docs; if the ``DOCS`` variable isn't set, it defaults
          to generating HTML docs.
        + ``lint``: run pylint on ``$(LINTMOD)``, which should be the main project
          module.
        + ``setup``: use pip to install the project requirements.
        + ``test``: run pytest on the ``tests`` module.
        + ``viewdocs``: run ``$(SRVMOD)`` (which defaults to ``http.server``) on the
          HTML Sphinx documentation.
