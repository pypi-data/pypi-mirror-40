Description: # Notes to Keep
        Export all your [Apple iCloud Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes) on macOS to [Google Keep](https://keep.corp.google.com).
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install notes_to_keep
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        Usage:
            notes_to_keep <email> <password> [options]
            notes_to_keep --help
            notes_to_keep --version
        
        Arguments:
            <email>           Your Google account
            <password>        The password of your Google account
        
        Options:
            --num=<num>       The number of notes to be exported to Google
                              Keep (default: all notes will be exported)
            --prefix=<pfx>    Append a prefix before the title of all notes.
                              A pair of [] will be put around it
                              automatically. (Default: empty)
            --no-time         Do not include creation time of the original
                              note and its import time to Google Keep. By
                              default, the creation time and import time is
                              included as text at the beginning of the note
                              in Google Keep.
            --no-label        Do not create a label for all imported notes.
                              By default, we will create a new label for
                              all imported notes.
        ```

        ## Known Issues
        This is still Alpha-quality, and is likely to have bugs. Use at your own risks. Below are some currently known issues waiting to be fixed:
        
        * It doesn't upload any photos, attachments, etc. to Google Keep. It uploads text, and only text.
        * It doesn't shorten the title, so in some extreme cases Google back-end might throw a 500 (also 500 for some other situations like certain special characters that Google doesn't support). But for most of your notes (almost all), it's gonna be just fine (2 in my 2000+ notes went wrong).
