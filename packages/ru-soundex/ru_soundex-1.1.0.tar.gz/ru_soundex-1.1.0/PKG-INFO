Description: # Soundex for Russian
        Russian, English and Finnish Phonetic algorithm based on Soundex.
        
        Package has both implemented phoneme transformation into letter-number sequence and distance engine for comparison of Soundex sequences (based on Levenstein distance).
        
        ### Quick start
        1. Install this package via ```pip```
        
        ```python
        pip install ru-soundex
        ```
        
        2. Import Soundex algorithm.
        
        Package supports a lot of opportunities, it's possible to cut a result sequence (like in the original Soundex version) or also code vowels.
        
        ```python
        from ru_soundex.soundex import RussianSoundex
        
        soundex = RussianSoundex(delete_first_letter=True)
        soundex.transform('ёлочка')
        ...
        
        J070530
        
        soundex = Soundex(delete_first_letter=True, code_vowels=True)
        soundex.transform('ёлочка')
        ...
        
        JA7A53A
        ```
        
        > A structure of the library is scalable, `RussianSoundex` class inherits basic class `Soundex` (original for English language). In order to extend our algorithm, you need just inherit own class from `Soundex` and override methods.
        
        3. Import Soundex distance for usage of string comparision
        
        ```python
        from ru_soundex.distance import SoundexDistance
        
        soundex = RussianSoundex(delete_first_letter=True)
        soundex_distance = SoundexDistance(soundex)
        soundex_distance.distance('ёлочка', 'йолочка')
        ...
        
        0
        ```
