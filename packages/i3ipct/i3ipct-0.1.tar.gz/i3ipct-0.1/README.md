# i3ipc-python-tools

Additions to i3ipc to ease finding and focusing containers in the i3 tree.

## About

This package was created from my need to have a directional focus (left/right, up/down) of i3 windows and is build up on the [i3ipc](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python/) package.

This package also includes extended ways of finding containers in the i3 tree.

There is an example for focusing windows. If You are interested in examples for finding containers, write me, and I may add a short example.

## Installation

```
pip install i3ipct
```
