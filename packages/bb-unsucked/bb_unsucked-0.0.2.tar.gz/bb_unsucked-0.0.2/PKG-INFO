        # Blackboard Unsucked
        
        _crummy name for a fix of crummy software_
        
        If you are a student or faculty at ODU I'm sure you're no stranger
        to wasting 2-3 hours a day trying to find or post assignments via BlackBoard.
        
        I am concerned with the student's view, but I hope this experiment can
        prove useful for professors as well. The goal is to wrap around existing
        BlackBoard infrastructure and provide a CLI API to access all the important functions
        which usually are trapped behind 4-5 links and a total 20-30 second browser load time.
        
        # Specific Goals
        
         - [x] Login to BB
         - [x] List classes for the current semester only (hide irrelevant ones)
         - [x] List all announcements
         - [x] List assignments for a given class
          - This will have to be sort of intelligent as professors put assignments in different places
         - [ ] Submit files for assignments
         - [ ] View/Post to discussion boards
         - [ ] Caching and Daemon operation, to prevent having to hit the network for most data access
        
        
        # Dependencies
        
        Python3 `requests`, and `BeautifulSoup`, both of which can be 
        installed via `pip3`
        
        # Usage
        
        To perform the authentication step the most reliable method is to
        save a `.har` file of a recent blackboard session. `bb_unsucked` is
        capable of parsing authentication session cookies out of the file `recent_request.har`.
