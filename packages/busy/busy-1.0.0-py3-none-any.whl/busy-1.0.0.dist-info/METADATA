# Busy

A task and plan management tool, for use from the terminal prompt on Linux and MacOS systems.

## Installation

```
pip3 install busy
```

## Getting started

Add some tasks to your queue.

```
busy add "Take a shower"
busy add "Do the laundry"
busy add "Phone mom"
busy add "Donate to the Busy project"
```

Find out what to do next:

```
busy get
```

Returns:

```
Take a shower
```

When you're done, mark it off to find the next task.

```
busy delete; busy get
```

Returns:

```
Do the laundry
```

See the whole queue, with sequence numbers.

```
busy list
```

Returns:

```
1  Do the laundry
2  Phone mom
3  Donate to the Busy project
```

Decide to do the top task later.

```
busy drop; busy list
```

Returns:

```
1  Phone mom
2  Donate to the Busy project
3  Do the laundry
```

Decide to do a specific task now.

```
busy pop 2; busy get
```

Returns:

```
Donate to the Busy project
```

Push that task to tomorrow.

```
busy defer --to tomorrow
```

Get all the tasks scheduled for today.

```
busy activate --today
```

### Core Commands

- `add` adds a new item to the bottom of the queue. The item description may be included after the command or written to stdin.
- `get` gets the top item in the queue, referred to as the "current" item. There are no options.
- `list` lists the items in the queue in order with their sequence numbers.
- `pop` moves a task or set of items to the top of a queue.
- `drop` moves a task or set of items to the bottom of a queue.
- `delete` permanently removes a task or set of items from a queue. Deletion requires confirmation via input or the `--yes` option.
- `manage` opens a text editor to edit items.

The `list`, `pop`, `drop`, `delete` and `manage` commands allow the designation of specific items.

Item designation can be performed using sequence numbers or tags.

### Sequence Numbers

Sequence numbers appear in the output from the `list` command. Note that the numbering starts with 1, and is not an ID -- the number of a item will change when the queue is modified. So always reference the most recent output from the `list` command.

When used to designate items, a range of sequence numbers is separated by a hyphen, with no whitespace, and is inclusive. For example, `4-6` designates items 4, 5, and 6. A hyphen without a number after it includes all the items from that item to the end of the queue. A hyphen on its own indicates the last item in the queue.

### Tags

Items can have tags, which are space-separated hashtags in the item description. A task can have no tags, one tag, or more than one tag. For example the following item description has the tag "errands":

```
go to the supermarket #errands
```

The hash itself ("#") is omitted from the command line when designating items by tag.

### Item Designations

Item designations appear after the command. For example, the following command will move all the items with the `#errands` hash to the top of the queue.

```
busy pop errands
```

Whitespace-separated item designation criteria are additive -- that is, a logical OR. For example, the following command will delete all the admin tasks, sales tasks, and tasks 3 and 4.

```
busy delete admin sales 3 4
```

Below are some further examples of task designations by sequence number.

`busy list` lists all the tasks

`busy list 5` shows only task number 5

`busy list 3-7` shows tasks 3-7

`busy list 3-` show tasks 3 through the end

`busy list 3 5 7 9` shows the tasks designated

`busy list -` shows the last task

`busy list -4` is an error! Use `busy list 1-4` instead.

Items will always be handled in the order they appear in the queue, regardless of the order the criteria are provided. So for example, if a `pop` command designates some items, they will be moved to the top of the queue in the order, relative to each other, they currently appear in the queue.

The sequence numbers in the `list` command output are from the queue itself. So the `list` command does not modify the sequence numbers, even when item designation is applied.

Commands that accept item designations support logical defaults, which are:

| **Command** | **Default item(s)** |
| ---         | ---              |
| `list`      | All items        |
| `pop`       | Last item        |
| `drop`      | First item       |
| `delete`    | First item       |
| `manage`    | All items        |

### Alternate Queues

Busy will manage any number of queues. For example, you might have a `shopping` queue for items to buy at the store, and a `movies` queue for films you'd like to watch. The default queue is called `todo` and has special properties related to planning.

To designate an alternate queue, use the `--queue` option on the command.

```
busy add "Skimmed Milk" --queue shopping
busy get --queue movies
```

### Managing Plans with the `defer` and `activate` commands

The default `todo` queue supports several specific commands related to planning -- that is, scheduling tasks for the future. Planned tasks are kept in another special queue called `plan`.

There are two commands related to plan management.

- `defer` removes a task or set of tasks from the `todo` queue and schedules it or them to reappear at a future date in the `plan` queue.
- `activate`removes a task or set of tasks from the `plan` queue and replaces it or them into the `todo` queue.

The `defer` and `activate` commands accept item designations. The `defer` command deals with the `todo` queue; its default is the top item in the `todo` queue. The `activate` command deals with the `plan` queue; its default is all the items scheduled for the current date or earlier.

Planning is by date, not time, and is relative to the current date according to the system clock.

In the `defer` command, the date can be specified using the `--to` or `--for` option (they are interchangable). If the options are omitted, then the date can be provided as input.

The date may take any of the following forms:

- A specific date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, such as `2018-10-28`
- An integer, a space, and the word `day` or `days`, such as `4 days`, which will defer the item to that number of days from today
- An integer without a space and the letter `d`, such as `4d`, which is a short form of `4 days`
- The word `tomorrow`, which is also the default if no date is provided

As an example, the following command will defer tasks 4, 5, and 6 from the `todo` queue to the date 4 days from today, keeping them in the `plan` queue until that date.

```
busy defer 4-6 --for 4 days
```

Note that the `plan` queue is keeping the task information (verbatim from the `todo` queue) along with the date information (as an absolute date).

To pull tasks off the `plan` queue and put them back on the `todo` queue, use the `activate` command. There are two ways to use the `activate` command:

- With the `--today` option, which is the normal way, and activates all the tasks scheduled for today or earlier, bringing the `todo` list up to date
- With designated items from the `plan` queue

If no items are designated, and there is no `--today` option, no tasks will be activated.


### Projects and the `start` command

Another special feature of the `todo` and `plan` queues is the `start` command, which deals with projects.

If a task has tags, the first tag is considered to be its "project" for the purposes of the `start` command.

The `start` command is used to start work on a project. If an argument is passed to the command, that's the chosen project. Otherwise the chosen project is the project of the current task (the top item in the `todo` queue). The command basically combines steps:

- Calls `activate --today` so the active task list is up-to-date
- Calls `manage` on the project, to edit the list of tasks for the project
- Calls `pop` on the project, so its tasks are at the top of the list

### Details of the `manage` command

The `manage` command launches the user's default text editor to directly edit a queue or part of a queue.

Busy uses the `sensible-editor` command to select a text editor, which works with default Ubuntu Linux installations and might or might not work with other operating systems.

The default use of `manage` will edit the entire queue.

```
busy manage --queue movies
```

But it's also possible to designate tasks to be managed. The `manage` command does its best to replace the edited items in place in the list order. So if you `manage` the current project (in which all the tasks are at the top), then the edited tasks will still appear at the top. Even if you add tasks, they will be inserted after the last task in the managed set, not at the end of the list. But all the tasks brought up in the editor will be managed. So if you remove a task in the editor, it will be deleted and the others will be moved up to take its place.



### Data storage

Busy keeps the queues in plain text files, so if the tool doesn't do something you want, you can just edit the files. The files are in a directory together, referred to as the "root". Each file is the name of the queue with a `.txt` extension. If a required file is missing, it will be created automatically. So typically, the root includes `todo.txt`, `plan.txt`, and any number of custom queue files.

Technically, they are pipe-delimited data files, though `todo.txt` only has one field (description); `plan.txt` has only two fields (date and description), and there is no support for managing separate fields in the Busy tool itself.

The root is designated in one of the following ways, which are tried in order.

- The `--root` option on the command
- The `BUSY_ROOT` environment variable, if no `--root` option is provided
- A directory at `~/.busy`, which will be generated as needed if no `--root` option or `BUSY_ROOT` environment variable are provided,

Note that the `--root` option must come after `busy` but command-specific options (`--yes`, `--to`, `--for`, `--queue`, and `--today`) must come after commands.

The following example shows the `--root` option with command-specific options on the same command line.

```
busy --root ~/.config/busy activate --today
```

Note that Busy does not support concurrency in any form. If two commands are executing at the same time, they may overwrite each other. Overwriting is especially risky with the `manage` command, which keeps the user's editor open until they close it.

## Development

Although it requires Python 3.6.5 or higher, Busy is designed to function with the Python standard library without any additional pip modules.

However, we use coverage during unit testing, so:

```
pip3 install coverage
```

Then to run the test suite:

```
make test
```

Or to run test coverage:

```
make cover
```
