        Intro:
        ======
        
        Agnostic schema that was inspired by many others, in other words, yet another
        one. What makes it different? Paradgim. If you need something special then
        extend and/or override, **python-schema** stays simple AND easy.
        
        Feel free to take a look at other solution that I was trying and utlimately
        have become inspiration for this library.
        
        Schema (https://pypi.org/project/schema/)
        -----------------------------------------
        
        What I liked:
        
        - simple
        
        What I do not like:
        
        - too simple, it makes code escalate quickly towards hard to comprehend structures
        - not obvious to override functionality
        - if python has classes why not to use them?
        
        Marshmallow (https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/)
        --------------------------------------------------------
        
        What I liked:
        
        - capable
        - easy to read
        - classes
        
        What I do not like:
        
        - pre-processing, post-processing, methods
        - agnostic yet integrates with orms
        - metaclasses
        
        JSON Schema (https://json-schema.org/)
        --------------------------------------
        
        What I liked:
        
        - interdisciplinary
        - easy to read
        
        What I do not like:
        
        - python implementations are not feature complete
        - complex validation not yet supported (as of 2018-04-01)
        - issue with inheritenace and marking field as required (or not) (as of 2018-04-01)
        
        WTForms (https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        What I liked:
        
        - classes
        - easy to read
        
        What I do not like:
        
        - it's forms, overkill for micro-services
        
        What is python-schema then:
        ===========================
        
        All above but trimmed down to essentials.
        
        You have:
        
        - schema
        - required fields (which support inheritance and complex tree structures)
        - validation (rudimentary, but extendable)
        - it accepts only dictionaries on entry
        - but outputs python code or json code
        - if in doubt, override!
        
        You do not have:
        
        - decorators
        - non-dictionaries
        - magic methods that will do something
        - integration with anything
        - bloat
        
        Premise
        =======
        
            I. Each schema is a Field that may or may not have more fields.
        
            II. Each field behaves same way, that is:
        
                a. normalisation
        
                b. validation
        
                c. ready-to-use
        
            III. Schema loads data and dumps data using context (whatever it means, require your implementation)
        
            IV. Each schema can be converted back to dictionary (keeping some values closer to python ie imaginary numbers or date object) or json (enforcing casting to format json can understand - mostly strings for almost anything else than numbers)
        
            V. If you need more complex functionality you are expected to subclass python-schema
