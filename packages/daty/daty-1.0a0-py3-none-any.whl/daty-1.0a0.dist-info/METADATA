*Daty* is a free cross-platform advanced Wikidata editor adhering to [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/), intended to enable better editing workflow and faster deployment of requested user features.
Use *Daty* to search, select, read, batch edit items, script actions, share, visualize proposed changes and bots.

*Daty* is written in Python 3 and it uses [GTK+ 3.0](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/) python bindings for interface organization and drawing.

It has a progressive layout thanks to [libhandy](https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy) and uses [pywikibot](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/profile/87/) as a backend.

## Currently implemented
- [X] Search and open entities through elasting search and triplets;
- [X] Read entities and follow their values;
- [ ] Page and sidebar search;
- [ ] Edit statements;
- [ ] Mass-edit statements.
