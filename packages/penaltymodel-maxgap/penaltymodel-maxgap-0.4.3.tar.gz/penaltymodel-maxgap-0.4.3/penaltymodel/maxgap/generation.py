    """Generates the Ising model that induces the given feasible configurations.

    Args:
        graph (nx.Graph): The target graph on which the Ising model is to be built.
        feasible_configurations (dict): The set of feasible configurations
            of the decision variables. The key is a feasible configuration
            as a tuple of spins, the values are the associated energy.
        decision_variables (list/tuple): Which variables in the graph are
            assigned as decision variables.
        linear_energy_ranges (dict, optional): A dict of the form
            {v: (min, max, ...} where min and max are the range
            of values allowed to v.
        quadratic_energy_ranges (dict): A dict of the form
            {(u, v): (min, max), ...} where min and max are the range
            of values allowed to (u, v).
        smt_solver_name (str/None): The name of the smt solver. Must
            be a solver available to pysmt. If None, uses the pysmt default.

    Returns:
        tuple: A 4-tuple contiaing:

            dict: The linear biases of the Ising problem.

            dict: The quadratic biases of the Ising problem.

            float: The ground energy of the Ising problem.

            float: The classical energy gap between ground and the first
            excited state.

    Raises:
        ImpossiblePenaltyModel: If the penalty model cannot be built. Normally due
            to a non-zero infeasible gap.
