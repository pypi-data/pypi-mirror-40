The goal of mcfly is to ease the use of deep learning technology for time series classification. The advantage of deep learning is that it can handle raw data directly, without the need to compute signal features. Deep learning does not require  expert domain knowledge about the data, and has been shown to be competitive with conventional machine learning techniques. As an example, you can apply mcfly on accelerometer data for activity classification, as shown in [the tutorial](https://github.com/NLeSC/mcfly-tutorial).



## Installation

Prerequisites:

- Python 2.7, 3.5 or 3.6

- pip



Installing all dependencies in sparate conda environment:

```sh

conda env create -f environment.yml



# activate this new environment

source activate mcfly

```



To install the package, run in the project directory:



`pip install .`



### Installing on Windows

When installing on Windows, there are a few things to take into consideration. The preferred (in other words: easiest) way to install Keras and mcfly is as follows:

* Use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

* Use Python 3.x, because tensorflow is not available on Windows for Python 2.7

* Install numpy and scipy through the conda package manager (and not with pip)

* To install mcfly, run `pip install mcfly` in the cmd prompt.

* Loading and saving models can give problems on Windows, see https://github.com/NLeSC/mcfly-tutorial/issues/17



## Visualization

We build a tool to visualize the configuration and performance of the models. The tool can be found on http://nlesc.github.io/mcfly/. To run the  model visualization on your own computer, cd to the `html` directory and start up a python web server:



`python -m http.server 8888 &`



Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/` in your browser to open the visualization. For a more elaborate description of the visualization see [user manual](https://mcfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual.html).
