        Retrieve all major games played on a given day.

        Builds a URL based on the requested date and downloads the HTML
        contents before parsing any and all games played during that day. Any
        games that are found are added to the boxscores dictionary with
        high-level game information such as the home and away team names and a
        link to the boxscore page.

        Parameters
        ----------
        date : datetime object
            The date to search for any matches. The month, day, and year are
            required for the search, but time is not factored into the search.
        end_date : datetime object
            Optionally specify an end date to iterate until. All boxscores
            starting from the date specified in the 'date' parameter up to and
            including the boxscores specified in the 'end_date' parameter will
            be pulled. If left empty, or if 'end_date' is prior to 'date', only
            the games from the day specified in the 'date' parameter will be
            saved.
