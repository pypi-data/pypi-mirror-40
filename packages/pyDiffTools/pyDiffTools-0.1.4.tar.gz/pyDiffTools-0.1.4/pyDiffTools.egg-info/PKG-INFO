        this is a set of tools to help with merging, mostly for use with vim_.
        
        at this stage, it's a very basic and development-stage repository.
        the scripts are accessed with the command ``pydifft``
        
        included are:
        
        - `pydifft sc` ("split conflicts"): a very basic merge tool that takes a conflicted file and generates a .merge_head and .merge_new file, where basic 
        
            * you can use this directly with gvimdiff, you can use the files in a standard gvimdiff merge
        
                * unlike the standard merge tool, it will 
        
            * less complex than the gvimdiff merge tool used with git.
        
            * works with "onewordify," below
        
        - `pydifft wmatch` ("whitespace match"): a script that matches whitespace between two text files.
        
            * pandoc can convert between markdown/latex/word, but doing this messes with your whitespace and gvimdiff comparisons.
        
            * this allows you to use an original file with good whitespace formatting as a "template" that you can match other (e.g. pandoc converted file) onto another
        
        - `pydifft wd` ("word diff"): generate "track changes" word files starting from pandoc markdown in a git history.  Assuming that you have copied diff-doc.js (copied + licensed from elsewhere) into your home directory, this will use pandoc to convert the markdown files to MS Word, then use the MS Word comparison tool to generate a document where all relevant changes are shown with "track changes."
        
            * by default, this uses the file `template.docx` in the current directory as a pandoc word template
        
        - a script that searches a notebook for numbered tasks, and sees whether or not they match (this is for organizing a lab notebook, to be described)
        
        Future versions will include:
        
        - Scripts for converting word html comments to latex commands.
        
        - converting to/form one word per line files (for doing things like wdiff, but with more control)
