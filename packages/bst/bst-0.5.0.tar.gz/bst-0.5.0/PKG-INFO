        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rgilbert1/bst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rgilbert1/bst)
        
        In school, I struggled with how binary search trees (and related data structures & algorithms) work, but now with a little more programming experience under my belt I decided to work through implementing one. It currently has insert, search, and traversal functionality.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip install bst
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from bst import BST
        
        bst = BST()
        bst.insert(5)
        node = bst.search(5)  # <bst.Node object at 0x1060964e0>
        node.value  # 5
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        The only dependency is `nose`, it's used to automatically run all of the unit tests in `tests/`. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run the tests with `nosetests -v`.
