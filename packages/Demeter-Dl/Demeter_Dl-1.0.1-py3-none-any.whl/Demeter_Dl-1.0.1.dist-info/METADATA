* Hit enter to continue.
* On completion a audible bell will pe played.
* and new instance will be initiated.

some special urls ;)

* art
* clear
* about


***

##Using in your own code (Intoduction):

Let's start out project By downloading a Test File.

***The file url: https://speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin ***

Make sure the link is working else report.

Let's get started.

	from demeter_dl.Core import HarvesterEngine
	url = "https://speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin"
	download_instance = HarvesterEngine(url)  # This will use the default options
	print(download_instance.Get_info())

####OUTPUT

>FILE NAME     : 100MB.bin,
FILE SIZE     : 100.0 MB(104857600 Bytes),
TARGET        : 


This Patch of code will initiate a download instance and print the information of the file

Now let's see what are the the options availabe during initiation(params):

* **file_name** : Override the filename from the server
* **location**: Overide the file location (Default is the current directory)
* **part_location**: location of the part files (temporary files, Default is current directory)
* **no_of_parts**: How many parts the file will be devided into for speed(More is not always better, Default is 16)
* **max_alive_at_once**: Max no of parts. (Max part allowed to download at the same time Default is 8)

so it seems there are preety good options let's use some

	from demeter_dl.Core import HarvesterEngine
	url = "https://speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin"
	download_instance = HarvesterEngine(url, file_name="Test file.bin", location="Downloads/")  # This will use the custom options
	print(download_instance.Get_info())

####OUTPUT

>FILE NAME     : Test file.bin,
FILE SIZE     : 100.0 MB(104857600 Bytes),
TARGET        : Downloads/

satisfied with the output now we will proceed to download the file:
(It's simple AF)

	download_instance.Download()

wait for it to finish and you will see the file in Donwloads folder in your current directory.
For more info go through the cli.py file in src. (Documention is on the way).
