Generate Pythonic Schematics_ representation of ProtoBuf .proto files.

The motive behind it is to create a comfortable mapping in Python to work with ProtoBuf messages represented in JSON or any other serializable form.

Most of the existing interfaces I've found optimize for performance and (apparently) a hellish pythonic interface. This package come to solve that by translating to ProtoBuf **.proto** files to nice and clean Schematics_ models. The hellish ProtoBuf API is converted in the awesome and fluent Schematics_ flow.

**Notice**: Performance was not considered while developing this package.

Features
--------

* TODO


Development
-----------

First, install the Pipfile and create the proper virtual environment::

    pipenv install --dev

To check linting with **flake8**, run::

    make lint

To run the unittests against your working python version::

    py.test

To see coverage report::

    make coverage

To run tests against all supported python versions::

    tox

To make the docs (which will be automatically published to readthedocs on commits to the master branch)::

    make docs

The parsing work of **.proto** files is provided thanks to the awesome guys at PyroBuf_.

This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `elgertam/cookiecutter-pipenv`_ project template, based on `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_.

In Progress
___________
* Add more meaningful unittests.
* Add more explanations for how load ProtoBuf encoded messages with the generated classes.
* Update the setup.py to PyroBuf 0.8.5 on PyPi when they will release latest version to PyPi.

0.1.0 (2019-01-13)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
* CLI interface for compiling a given proto file to schematics definition file.
