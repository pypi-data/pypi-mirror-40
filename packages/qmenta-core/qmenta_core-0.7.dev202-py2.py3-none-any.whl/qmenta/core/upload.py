    Parameters
    ----------
    auth : Auth
        The object used to authenticate to the QMENTA platform.

    file_info : FileInfo
        All the metadata for the file to be stored in the platform.
    anonymise : bool

    Attributes
    ----------
    upload_filename : str

        will be the same as filename. With anonymisation enabled, a new file
        will be created that contains the anonymised data.
    upload_id : str
        The upload session ID. This will be automatically generated and
        depends on the current time and the filename.
    chunk_size : int
        Size in bytes of each chunk. Should be expressed as a power of 2.
        Default value is 512 KB.
        It is recommended to use the default value. We expose the variable
        to speed up unit tests with tiny file sizes.
    file_size : int
        The size in bytes of the file to be uploaded. Automatically determined
        when the SingleUpload object is constructed.
    status_message : str
