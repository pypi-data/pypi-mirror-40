        An Association List construct for Python
        
        ---
        
        This simple library provides an AList object that should be a drop-in replacement for most dictionaries, but based on immutable data structures instead.
        
        Cheap to construct, expensive to mutate, as it isn't mutable. Every mutative method actually generates a new AList in it's place.
        
        Example:
        
        ```
        import alist
        
        # This is cheap:
        a = alist.AList(x=0,y=1)
        
        # This is also cheap:
        print(a['x'])
        
        # This is expensive:
        a['x'] = 12
        ```

        ## Differences to Dictionaries
        
        There's primarily two differences:
        
        * Mutating the AList is expensive, rather than cheap.
        
        * Setting the same key multiple times at init time is a ValueError.
        
        That is, Python is happy with:
        
        ```
        {'x': 0, 'x': 4}
        > {'x': 4}
        ```
        
        That sort of behaviour might be unexpected, or cause unexpected problems for the programmer.
        
        So, instead alist:
        
        ```
        alist.AList(x=0, x=4)
        > Exception raised, ValueError
        ```
        
        ## Explicit API
        
        There isn't one yet.
        
        Check back in future versions.

        ## Testing
        
        Install ```pytest```, and then run it.
        
        Currently 28 tests for 20 methods.
