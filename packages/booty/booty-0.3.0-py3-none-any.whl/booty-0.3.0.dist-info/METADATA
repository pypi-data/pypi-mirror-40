====================
Purpose
====================

This code base is for creating a bootloader to be utilized for programming microcontroller flash
memory.  This program takes a hex file as the input and will parse that hex file and send it to
the microcontroller bootloader over a serial UART (commonly referred to as a "serial port" or
"COM port").

The companion project to this is the `bootypic <http://github.com/slightlynybbled/bootypic>`_ project.
Hopefully, more will follow.  GUI provided at `bootycontrol <http://github.com/slightlynybbled/bootycontrol>`_.

Please see the `documentation <https://booty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for further guidance!
