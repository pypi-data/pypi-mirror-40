*** What is Balazar Brother???

Balazar Brothers is a libre software 3D puzzle game!



*** Warning!

Between two releases of Balazarn Brothers, don't expect that you can
re-use your saved games! If you want to play a new level without
restarting at the beginning of the game, use the --start-level option
and create a new game (by choosing a new player name), e.g.:

    balazar_brothers --start-level pompon_forest



*** Help needed!

We espescially search for graphists, network coders, level
designer,...

We also search people for porting Balazar to other OS.



*** Requirement

 * Python 2.4.x (the latest is the best; tested on 2.4.1)
   INCLUDING the files for compiling python modules in C,
   e.g. , on Linux Mandrake, you need to install the package :
   'libpython2.4-devel-2.4.1-2mdk' (version numbers may change)

 * PIL (Python Imaging Library, http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

 * OpenGL (tested with ATI Radeon drivers; hardware acceleration is
   heavily advised, though not strictly required)

 * SDL (http://libsdl.org/)

 * Glew (http://glew.sf.net)

 * OpenAL (www.openal.org), PyOgg and PyVorbis (www.xiph.org) for
   sound support.

 * Cal3D >= 0.10 (cal3d.sourceforge.net)
   
 * Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com)

 * FreeType (http://freetype.org)

The Balazar Brothers tarball comes with all other dependencies
(including Soya 3D and Tofu).



*** Installation

tar -xvzf BalazarBrothers-XXX.tar.gz
cd BalazarBrothers-XXX

 * Do:

python ./setup.py build

 * Do AS ROOT:

su
python ./setup.py install

You may get the following warning:

  warning: install: modules installed to '/usr/share/',
  which is not in Python's module search path (sys.path)
  -- you'll have to change the search path yourself

You can safely ignore the warning !



*** How to launch Balazar ?

Just type "balazar_brothers" on a console !

There's also a command line interface, see "balazar_brothers --help"
for more information.

While playing, use left and right shift keys.


*** Common troubles

 * Sound problems : OpenAL may not support your sound card (e.g.
   sound quality is poor, and you get some error printed on the
   console, about "native_blitbuffer: Assertion `0' failed" or "fcntl:
   Invalid argument"). Some people has obtained good result by forcing
   the use of esd. For that, edit ~/.openalrc, and write in it :
   
     (define devices '(esd))

 * ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot handle TLS data
   This problem occurs typically on Debian with NVidia cards.
   Just install the "nvidia-glx" Debian package.
