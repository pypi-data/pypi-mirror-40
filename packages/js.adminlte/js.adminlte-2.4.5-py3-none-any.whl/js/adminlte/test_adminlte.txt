How to use?
===========

This should be setup before rendering a page. See `fanstatic`_ for more
information::

  >>> from fanstatic import init_needed
  >>> needed = init_needed(base_url='http://localhost')

You can import ``adminlte`` from ``js.adminlte`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.adminlte import adminlte_js
  >>> adminlte_js.need()
