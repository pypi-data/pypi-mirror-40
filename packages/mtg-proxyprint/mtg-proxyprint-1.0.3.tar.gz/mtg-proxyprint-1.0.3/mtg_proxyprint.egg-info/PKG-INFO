Description: # TLDR
        
        This is a simple command line program to create proxy decks
        
        
        ```
            proxyprint decklist.txt
        ```
        This will create a "decklist" folder in your current directory
        and dump the jpeg images. There are a bunch of options
        exposed as command line options you can tweak. List
        them and get descriptions with:
        
        ```
            proxyprint --help
        ```
        
        ## Overview:
        
        Basically just a wrapper around:
        - mtgtools (and scryfall via this)
            - https://pypi.org/project/mtgtools/
            - https://scryfall.com/
        - tested with copy pasted decklists from mtgtop8.com no idea if they'll work with anything else
            - copy the decklist part of the page
            - open Notepad or equivalent raw text editor
            - save file as deckname.txt
            - `proxyprint deckname.txt`
