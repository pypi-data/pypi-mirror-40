This is a simple command line program to create proxy decks

Usage:
    
    proxyprint decklist.txt

This will create a "decklist" folder in your current directory
and dump the jpeg images. There are a bunch of options
exposed as command line options you can tweak. List
them with:

    proxyprint --help


Overview:

Basically just a wrapper around:
    - mtgtools (and scryfall via this)
    - tested with copy pasted decklists from mtgtop8.com
    no idea if they'll work with anything else
