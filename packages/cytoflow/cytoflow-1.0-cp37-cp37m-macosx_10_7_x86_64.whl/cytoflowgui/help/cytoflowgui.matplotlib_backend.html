  <span class="target" id="module-cytoflowgui.matplotlib_backend"></span><p>A matplotlib backend that renders across a process boundary.</p>
<p>By default, matplotlib only works in one thread.  For a GUI application, this
is a problem because when matplotlib is working (ie, scaling a bunch of data
points) the GUI freezes.</p>
<p>This module implements a matplotlib backend where the plotting done in one
process (ie via pyplot, etc) shows up in a canvas running in another process
(the GUI).  The canvas is the interface across the process boundary: a “local”
canvas, which is a GUI widget (in this case a QWidget) and a “remote” canvas
(running in the process where pyplot.plot() etc. are used.)  The remote canvas
is a subclass of the Agg renderer; when draw() is called, the remote canvas
pulls the current buffer out of the renderer and pushes it through a pipe
to the local canvas, which draws it on the screen.  blit() is implemented
too.</p>
<p>This takes care of one direction of data flow, and would be enough if we were
just plotting.  However, we want to use matplotlib widgets as well, which
means there’s data flowing from the local canvas to the remote canvas too.
The local canvas is a subclass of FigureCanvasQTAgg, which is itself a
sublcass of QWidget.  The local canvas overrides several of the event handlers,
passing the event information to the remote canvas which in turn runs the
matplotlib event handlers.</p>
