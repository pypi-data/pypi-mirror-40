  <span class="target" id="module-cytoflowgui.workflow"></span><p>The main model for the GUI.</p>
<p>At its core, the model is a list of WorkflowItem instances.  A WorkflowItem
wraps an operation, its completion status, the result of applying it to
the previous WorkflowItem’s result, and views on that result.  The Workflow
also maintains a “current” or selected WorkflowItem.</p>
<p>The left panel of the GUI is a View on this object (viewing the list of
WorkflowItem instances), and the right panel of the GUI is a View of the
selected WorkflowItem’s current view.</p>
<p>So far, so simple.  However, in a single-threaded GUI application, the UI
freezes when something processor-intensive is happening.  Adding another thread
doesn’t help matters because of the CPython global interpreter lock; while
Python is otherwise computing, the GUI doesn’t update.  To solve this, the
Workflow maintains a copy of itself in a separate process.  The local Workflow
is the one that is viewed by the GUI; the remote Workflow is the one that
actually loads the data and does the processing.  Thus the GUI remains
responsive.  Changed attributes in either Workflow are noticed by a set of
Traits handlers, which send those changes to the other process.</p>
<p>This process is also where the plotting happens.  For an explanation of how
the plots are ferried back to the GUI, see the module docstring for
matplotlib_backend.py</p>
