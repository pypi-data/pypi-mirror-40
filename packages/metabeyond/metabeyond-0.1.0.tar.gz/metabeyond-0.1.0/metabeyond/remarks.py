"""
"Annotation" decorators that can be applied to functions and classes as a way of tagging the object with
some form of metadata. This is designed to function in a similar way to Java 6 annotation interfaces.

Note:
    It is imperative to remember that remark decorators hand must be invoked with an argument list. An example being
    `@remark()` or `@remark(foo, bar)` or `@remark(f='foo', b='bar')`. These will add metadata to the decorated
    function or class that specifies the presence of that decorator on the object, and this can be
    queried at runtime, which requires marginally more resources than if we were to not use it at all.
    Calling *without* parenthesis `()` is invalid.

    Hints (provided by :mod:`metabeyond.hints`), on the other hand, are purely descriptive notes added to the docstring.
    They *must not* be called with arguments, for example `@hint`. Calling *with* parenthesis `()` will produce an
    invalid result, not decorating the given object correctly.

    Using the presence of parenthesis is a good way to determine if it is a documentation hint or a
    metadata remark. Metadata remarks are much more complicated than hints.

    To document parameter types and return types, one should use type annotations or comment-based
    annotations as per PEP 3107: `def foo(bar: int, baz: int) -> float:`. Utilities for this are in the
    Python :mod:`typing` module.

    Class that can be subclassed to produce remark decorators that behave similar to Java 6 annotations::

    >>> class Foo(Remark): ...

    >>> @Foo()
    ... def bar():
    ...     pass

    You may also make it accept other parameters.

    >>> class Baz(Remark):

    ...         super().__init__()
    ...         self.x = x
    ...         self.y = y

    And decorating with multiple remarks is also supported.

    >>> @Foo()
    ... @Baz(x=122, y=34)  # kwargs work too
    ... def bork():
    ...     pass

    Constraints
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    You can add a single runtime constraint onto a class in order to limit what it is allowed to decorate when used.
    These will be inherited regardless of whether you specify one or not.

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> class SomeRemark(Remark, constraint=asyncio.iscoroutinefunction):
    ...     ...

    >>> @SomeRemark()
    ... async def whatever():
    ...      "This is acceptable!"

    >>> @SomeRemark()
    ... def something_else():
    ...     "This will cause a type error..."

    Or supply multiple constraints in a collection type.

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> import inspect
    >>> class SomeOtherRemark(Remark,
    ...                       constraints=[
    ...                           asyncio.iscoroutinefunction,
    ...                           lambda o: bool(inspect.getdoc(o).strip())
    ...                       ]):
    ...    ...

    Constraints should be callable type `Callable[[ToDecorate], bool]`, meaning they take the decorated
    item as a sole parameter and return True if it is acceptable or False otherwise. They may alternatively
    raise their own exceptions for a more custom interface. Multiple constraints will all have to be True to enable
    the entire check suite to pass.

    Warning:
        Passing the `constraint` and `constraints` arguments together in the class definition will cause an error,
        because I deemed it a stupid thing to be doing. You have no need to use both. It is designed to be readable.

    Predicates
    ~~~~~~~~~~

    Since v0.1.0, predicates have also been supported in remarks. Predicates are similar to constraints in that they
    are executed across the decorated item when you decorate an object with the remark.

    The distinguishing feature is that whereas constraints will create an error when they fail, a predicate will
    only result in the object not being decorated by the remark if it fails.


    This is useful if you wish to only decorate an object based on some runtime condition, environment variable, or
    flag.

    As the name suggests, a predicate that returns True is considered to be successful, whereas a predicate that returns
    False or raises an :class:`Exception`-derived exception will be considered to have failed.

    Like constraints, a single predicate is provided with the `predicate` kwarg, or multiple predicates can be provided
    with the `predicates` kwarg.

    For example, adding a single predicate:

    >>> import os
    >>> class SomeRemark(Remark, predicate=lambda _: os.getenv('ADD_REMARKS', False)):
    ...    ...

    ... or multiple predicates with the following syntax:

    >>> import os
    >>> class SomeRemark(Remark, predicates=[lambda _: os.getenv('ADD_REMARKS', False), something_else]):
    ...    ...

    This remark would only apply to an object if the `ADD_REMARKS` environment variable was applied at the time
    the object was decorated.

    Warning:
        Passing the `predicate` and `predicates` arguments together in the class definition will cause an error,
        because I deemed it a stupid thing to be doing. You have no need to use both. It is designed to be readable.

    ------------

    Note:
        As this functionality is fairly difficult to debug due to its dynamic nature, enabling the `DEBUG` logging
        level for `metabeyond.remarks` in the standard Python logging module will enable exposing information regarding
        what is happening internally, such as the predicates and constraints that are failing, etc.
