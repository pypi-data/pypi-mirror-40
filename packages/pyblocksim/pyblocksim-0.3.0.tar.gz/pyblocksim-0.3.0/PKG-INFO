Description: Pyblocksim aims to mitigate the lack of a tool like Simulink (or scicos)
        in the world of python based scientific computing.
        It aims to enable you to quickly implement a model of a dynamic system
        which is suited to be modeled by the feedback-free
        directed interconnection of blocks such as transfer functions.
