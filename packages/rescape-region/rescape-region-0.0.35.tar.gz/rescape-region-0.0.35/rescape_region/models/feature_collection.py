    """
        Models a geospatial feature collection along with some metadata. The GEOS name for this is GeometryCollection
        and can store the geometry of a geojson feature collection.
        The metadata like name and description could be populated by the geojson that populates the geometry column
        (using for instance rescape_python_helpers.feature_collection_from_geojson).
        The reason we make a separate model for FeatureCollection rather than having classes like Region just use a
        GeometryField or GeometryCollectionField directly has to do with the implementation supporting
        geospatial fields in graphene, which can't handle multiple geospatial fields but can handle multiple
        foreign keys that point to objects one geospatial field.
