ITPE
====

Scripts for generating the masterpost HTML for ITPE (the Informal Twitter
Podfic Exchange).

Installation
------------

You need to install Python first.  You can download Python:

*  from the `official Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
*  using `conda <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#id4>`_

There are other ways to install Python, but these are probably the easiest
if you don't already have a working Python installation.

You may be asked "Python 2.7 or Python 3"?  Either should be fine -- these
scripts should work with any version of Python that you can install in 2018.

Once you have Python, install the scripts by running:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install itpe

Usage
-----

Once the scripts are installed, run ``itpe --help`` to get a usage message.
