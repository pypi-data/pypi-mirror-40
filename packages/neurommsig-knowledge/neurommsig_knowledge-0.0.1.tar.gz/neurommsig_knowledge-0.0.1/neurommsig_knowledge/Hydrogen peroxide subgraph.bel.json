Glutathione, which is involved in cellular redox homeostasis, inhibited the increase of AChE activity, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in this process. Further investigation showed that the elevation of AChE was observed after the degradation of Akt, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of caspase family members. When nerve growth factor (NGF) was present, with the maintenance of Akt level, the elevation of AChE, the cytochrome c diffusion, as well as apoptotic process were markedly attenuated in H2O2-treated PC12 cells", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "17213958"}, "annotations": {"Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Subgraph": {"Acetylcholine signaling subgraph": true, "Hydrogen peroxide subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "object": {"modifier": "Activity", "effect": {"name": "pep", "namespace": "bel"}}, "source": 2, "target": 20, "key": "4ea6a82f699eb493785ee9a9f56c70d912ad17277ab4c7190e823e44bae98d423a13c147cb18f9bdba6bb2b75546cf0d5e1c0b50ff2aa2cfe2d5ce1d15c25211"}, {"line": 3976, "relation": "negativeCorrelation", "evidence": "AChE activity was reported to be enhanced by low concentrations of H2O2. explanation is that mitochondrial efflux H2O2 modifies membrane structure through lipid peroxidation, and therefore contributes to modify the activity of the membrane-bound protein AChE [31].

Further investigation showed that the elevation of AChE was observed after the degradation of Akt, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of caspase family members.
