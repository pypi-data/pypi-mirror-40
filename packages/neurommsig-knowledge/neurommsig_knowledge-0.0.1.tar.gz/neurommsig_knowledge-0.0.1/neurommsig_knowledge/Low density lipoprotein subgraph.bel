SET SupportingText = "There is a strong genetic risk for late-onset AlzheimerÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s disease (AD), but so far few gene variants have been identified that reliably contribute to that risk. A newly confirmed genetic risk allele C of the clusterin (CLU) gene variant rs11136000 is carried by approximately 88% of Caucasians. The C allele confers a 1.16 greater odds of developing late-onset AD than the T allele. AD patients have reductions in regional white matter integrity. We evaluated whether the CLU risk variant was similarly associated with lower white matter integrity in healthy young humans. Evidence of early brain differences would offer a target for intervention decades before symptom onset.  We scanned 398 healthy young adults (mean age 23.6 ÃâÃÂ± 2.2 years) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a variation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitive to white matter integrity in the living brain. We assessed genetic associations using mixed model regression at each point in the brain to map the profile of these associations with white matter integrity.  Each C allele copy of the CLU variant was associated with lower fractional anisotropy (FA) - a widely accepted measure of white matter integrity- in multiple brain regions, including several known to degenerate in AD. These regions included the splenium of the corpus callosum, the fornix, cingulum, and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi in both brain hemispheres.  Young healthy carriers of the CLU gene risk variant showed a distinct profile of lower white matter integrity that may increase vulnerability to developing AD later in life."

SET SupportingText = " Abeta is widely accepted to be one of the major pathomechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD), although there is presently lively debate regarding the relative roles of particular species/forms of this peptide. Most recent evidence indicates that soluble oligomers rather than plaques are the major cause of synaptic dysfunction and ultimately neurodegeneration. Soluble oligomeric Abeta has been shown to interact with several proteins, for example glutamatergic receptors of the NMDA type and proteins responsible for maintaining glutamate homeostasis such as uptake and release. As NMDA receptors are critically involved in neuronal plasticity including learning and memory, we felt that it would be valuable to provide an up to date review of the evidence connecting Abeta to these receptors and related neuronal plasticity. Strong support for the clinical relevance of such interactions is provided by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. This substance is the only NMDA receptor antagonist used clinically in the treatment of AD and therefore offers an excellent tool to facilitate translational extrapolations from in vitro studies through in vivo animal experiments to its ultimate clinical utility"

SET SupportingText = " Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related disorder characterized by deposition of Amyloid beta and degeneration of neurons in brain regions such as the hippocampus, resulting in progressive cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of AD is tightly linked to Amyloid beta deposition and oxidative stress, but it remains unclear as to how these factors result in neuronal dysfunction and death. We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta. Our findings suggest a sequence of events in the pathogenesis of AD in which Amyloid beta induces membrane-associated oxidative stress, resulting in perturbed ceramide and cholesterol metabolism which, in turn, triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that leads to clinical disease."

APP and beta-secretase, both present on cell surface, are endocytosed into endosomes to produce Abeta. The molecular mechanism by which neurons trigger the production of Abeta is poorly understood. We describe here evidence that the binding of lipid-carrying apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to receptor apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) triggers the endocytosis of APP, beta-secretase, and ApoER2 in neuroblastoma cells, leading to the production of Abeta. This mechanism, mediated by adaptor protein X11alpha or X11beta (X11alpha/beta), whose PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domain binds to APP and a newly recognized motif in the cytosolic domain of ApoER2. Isomorphic form ApoE4 triggers the production of more Abeta than by ApoE2 or ApoE3; thus, it may play a role in the genetic risk of ApoE4 for the sporadic AD."

SET SupportingText = "Endocytic APP Sorting and ABetaÂ¸ ProductionÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢â¬ï¿½Mutations within the YENPTY endocytosis motif selectively inhibit APP internalization and decrease ABetaÂ¸ generation. This motif and the flanking region serve as the binding site for many cytosolic adaptors with phosphotyrosine-binding domains, including Fe65, Fe65L1, Fe65L2, Mint1 (also called X11a), Mint2, Mint3, Dab1, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)-interacting protein family members. Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABetaÂ¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below). In addition to APP, Mint proteins can directly bind ADP-ribosylation factors; thus, Mint proteins can potentially regulate vesicular trafficking of APP by serving as coat proteins. Finally, the type I transmembrane protein SorLA/LR11 (a member of the VPS10p domain receptor family), which functionally interacts with cytosolic adaptors GGA and PACS-1, attenuates ABetaÂ¸ production by acting as a Golgi/TGN retention factor. SorLA/LR11 is also genetically associated with AD, thus further implicating this sorting molecule in APP biology"

SET SupportingText = "The surface levels of both APP and LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1), which are known to comigrate during trafficking, were dramatically reduced after metformin treatment as detected by biotinylation assays, whereas their total protein levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1D). However, the surface and the total BACE1 were markedly increased by metformin. Through further subfractionation, using sucrose gradients, we showed that metformin treatment caused changes in the compartmentalization of APP, as evidenced by increased distribution in trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles (fraction 2), including those trafficks en route to early endosomes and TGN (fraction 3), and decreased distribution in membranes (fraction 5) (Fig. S1 B and C). BACE1 protein levels were found to be elevated in all 3 fractions: 2, 3, and 5, with an Ã¢â°Ë2-fold increase of the total protein. The increased distribution of both APP and BACE1 in fractions 2 and 3 are expected to favor Abeta generation within TGN and/or endocytic compartments, the two compartments with mild acidic pH optimal for BACE1 activity (33, 34). Indeed, we detected increased immunofluorescent Abeta40 signals after metformin treatment in TGN (Fig. 1E)."

SET SupportingText = "integrins play important roles in neurite development, neuronal migration, and synapse functions. Several studies show that Reelin signaling has an important role in neuronal migration through its interaction with ApoE receptor 2 and the VLDL receptor, and the subsequent phosphorylation of Disabled-1. After removal of anyof these components (Reelin, receptors, or Disabled-1), cortical layer formation is severely disrupted, leading to the model that these interactions are important for laminar organization in development.In synapses, Reelin promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits (e.g., NR2A) and facilitates LTP. Reelin signaling has an important role in NMDA and AMPA receptor function, maturation of glutamatergic synapses.ÃÆÃÂ¸1 integrin facilitates reorganization of actin filaments and affects neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. The Reelin-a3ÃÆÃÂ¸1 integrin interaction regulates neuronal migration, perhaps by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton, or by stabilizing the cytoskeleton through n-cofilin phosphorylation. Integrins also regulate synaptic glutamate receptor function, synaptic plasticity, working memory, and LTP. The APP-ÃÆÃÂ¸1 integrin interaction is also important in neurite outgrowth. We suggest that the functions of Reelin and ÃÆÃÂ¸1 integrins on these processes may be modulated by APP (or other APP family members)."

However, mechanisms that regulate LRP1 expression under physiological and pathophysiological conditions are not unclear. In human cell lines, we found that miR-205 down-regulates the expression of LRP1 by targeting sequences in the 3'UTR of LRP1 mRNA. This effect was abolished by deleting the miR-205 seed site in the 3'UTR of LRP1. The ectopic expression of miR-205 also significantly mitigated migration of both U87 and SK-LU-1 cells. These results, for the first time, demonstrate that expression of human LRP1 is regulated in part by a specific miRNA, leading to decreased tumor cell migration."

Here we demonstrate that Idol also targets two closely related LDLR family members, VLDLR and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), proteins implicated in both neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Idol triggers ubiquitination of the VLDLR and ApoER2 on their cytoplasmic tails, leading to their degradation.We demonstrate that LXR activation results in decreased Reelin binding to VLDLR and reduced Dab1 phosphorylation. The identification of VLDLR and ApoER2 as Idol targets suggests potential roles for this LXR-inducible E3 ligase in the central nervous system in addition to lipid metabolism."

The neurotoxicity of Amyloid beta appears to be, at least in part, due to dysregulation of glutamate signaling. Here, we show that Amyloid beta promote extracellular accumulation of glutamate and d-serine, a co-agonist at glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype (NMDARs), in hippocampal neuronal cultures. Activation of inhibitory GABA(A) receptors by taurine blocked the increase in extracellular glutamate levels, suggesting that selective pharmacological inhibition of neuronal activity can counteract the impact of Amyloid beta on glutamate dyshomeostasis. Results reveal a novel mechanism by which Ab oligomers promote abnormal release of glutamate in hippocampal neurons, which may contribute to dysregulation of excitatory signaling in the brain"

ApoE is also a key ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), a major neuronal low-density lipoprotein receptor. ApoE and LRP mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the postmortem inferior temporal gyrus (area 20) and the hippocampus from individuals with dementia compared with those with intact cognition. In addition to their strong association with the progression of cognitive dysfunction, LRP and ApoE mRNA levels were also positively correlated with increasing neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Additionally, Western blot analysis of ApoE protein expression in the hippocampus showed that the differential expression observed at the transcriptional level is also reflected at the protein level. Given the critical role played by LRP and ApoE in amyloid beta (Abeta) and cholesterol trafficking, increased expression of LRP and ApoE may not only disrupt cholesterol homeostasis but may also contribute to some of the neurobiological features of AD, including plaque deposition."

SET SupportingText = "The oxidized LDL receptor 1 gene (OLR1) rs1050283 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been previously shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An association analysis of OLR1 was carried out in a population of 443 patients with AD as compared with 393 age-matched controls. In addition, an expression analysis of OLR1 and its regulatory hsa-miR369-3p was performed in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) from 20 patients and 15 controls. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for gender and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status, showed a statistically significant association of OLR1 rs1050283 under the assumption of a dominant model (CC and CT individuals versus TT: p = 0.014, OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.08-2.08) and a genotypic model (TC versus TT: p = 0.002, OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.14-2.26). No significant differences in OLR1 expression was observed between patients and controls (p > 0.05). However, stratifying patients according to the rs1050283 status, significantly decreased relative PBMC expression levels of OLR1 were observed in carriers of CC+CT genotypes as compared with TT carriers (0.13 ÃÆbetaÃâÃÂ± 0.013 versus 0.46 ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃÂ± 0.028, p = 0.022), whereas no differences in relative expression levels of the hsa-miR369-3p were observed (p > 0.05). The effect observed was not due to the presence of the ApoE Îµ4 allele. The OLR1 rs1050283 SNP likely acts as a risk factor for sporadic AD. The presence of at least one C allele is associated with a decreased expression of OLR1 mRNA in the absence of hsa-miR369-3p de-regulation, suggesting that the presence of the polymorphic allele influences the binding of hsa-miR369-3p to its 3'UTR consensus sequence. Nevertheless, the limited power of the study requires further investigations with a larger sample size."

SET SupportingText = "Cellular uptake and degradation by glial cells is one means by which ABetaÂ¸ may be cleared from the brain. In the current study, we demonstrate that modulating levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a cell surface receptor that regulates the amount of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the brain, altered both the uptake and degradation of ABetaÂ¸ by astrocytes. Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in ABetaÂ¸ uptake, while increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of ABetaÂ¸. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of ABetaÂ¸ and facilitated the vesicular transport of ABetaÂ¸ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on ABetaÂ¸ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we provide evidence that ABetaÂ¸ can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting an interaction between LDLR and ABetaÂ¸ could be responsible for LDLR-mediated ABetaÂ¸ uptake. Therefore, these results identify LDLR as a receptor that mediates ABetaÂ¸ uptake and clearance by astrocytes, and provide evidence that increasing glial LDLR levels may promote ABetaÂ¸ degradation within the brain"

SET SupportingText = "ApoE was reported to induce Dab1 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation and JNK inhibition via LRPs. This pathway depends on the presence of Ca++ influx through the NMDA receptor, but it is independent of Dab1.Overall these data indicate a likely involvement of LRP8 as modulator of AbetaPP processing, by affecting its endocytic trafficking and the proportion of AbetaPP present in lipid rafts. These events may have consequence on the gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of AbetaPP and on its neurodegeneration-related signaling activity."

Some of them possess shared adaptors with AbetaPP; in particular Fe65 and JIP1 bind to LRP8, LRP1, and megalin. Indeed gamma-secretase cleavage regulates the intramembrane proteolysis of LRP8, LRP1, and of SOR-1/LRP11. It is tempting to speculate that LRPs could affect AbetaPP processing and signaling (and vice versa) through gamma-secretase and ApoE-mediated stimuli."

PSs also affect different other signaling molecules, such as wingless-type MMTV integration site family (Wnt) signal transduction pathway, which is evolutionary conserved and controls many events during the embryogenesis . At cellular level, this pathway regulates morphology, proliferation, and motility of the cell. Wnt signaling pathway plays a central role during tumorigenesis, and the inappropriate activation of this pathway has been observed in several human cancers. It has been shown that Wnt-ligand-mediated signaling leads to the accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin. Cytosolic beta-catenin will then translocate into the nucleus to bind to members of the T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid-enhancing factor (Lef) family of DNA-binding proteins leading to the transcription of Wnt target genes."

LDLR possesses a wide array of ligands with different functions from cellular cholesterol uptake in the liver to cell specification and neuronal positioning during embryogenesis. ApoE, complexed in HDL and VLDL, is the major ligand for these receptors, and, being the e4 allele of APOE gene, the most relevant risk for the development of late-onset AD, several studies support a role for these receptors in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between ApoE alleles and AD development have not yet been completely elucidated, ApoE, along with its receptor-LDLR and LDL-receptors related protein (LRP), was reported to modulate Abeta production and clearance."

Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors. This reversal requires the LRP receptor-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family."

SET SupportingText = "APP (amyloid precursor protein) and LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD (Alzheimer's disease). They are functionally linked by Fe65, a PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding)-domain-containing adaptor protein that binds to intracellular NPxY-motifs of APP and LRP1, thereby influencing expression levels, cellular trafficking and processing. Additionally, Fe65 has been reported to mediate nuclear signalling in combination with intracellular domains of APP and LRP1. We have previously identified another adaptor protein, GULP1 (engulfment adaptor PTB-domain-containing 1). In the present study we characterize and compare nuclear trafficking and transactivation of GULP1 and Fe65 together with APP and LRP1 and report differential nuclear trafficking of adaptors when APP or LRP1 are co-expressed. The observed effects were additionally supported by a reporter-plasmid-based transactivation assay. The results from the present study indicate that Fe65 might have signalling properties together with APP and LRP1, whereas GULP1 only mediates LRP1 transactivation."

Cell biology experiments have indicated that SORL1 underexperssion leads to overproduction of Abeta3 , whereas SORL1 overexpression considerably reduces cellular APP and extracellular Abeta5. Although the underlying mechanisms of SORL1 in AD and neurodegenerative processes remain unclear, a recent comprehensive review on multiple functional domains of SORL1 suggested that SORL1 can assume various characters in AD pathogenesis"

A considerable interaction between age and the SORL1 genotypes was observed, showing an accelerated (downward) slope of GM volume differences in the right putamen of the participants carrying the AD-risk (A) allele compared with those carrying TT. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that SORL1 rs3824968 is associated with regional GM volume differences in early adulthood and can influence ageing-related GM morphological changes during the nondemented adult lifespan."

SET SupportingText = "SORL1 rs3824968 variants may influence amyloid pathology during ageing. Greater amyloid burden has been shown to be positively associated with regional GM atrophy26,27,28, particularly in the superior temporal, medial frontal, and cingulate gyri in both structural and functional MRI studies29,30. In addition to the hypothesis of amyloid pathology, Cuenco et al.31 proposed another viewpoint that SORL1 increases dementia risk through effects on cerebrovascular abnormalities; SORL1 rs3824968 and its haplotypes were found to be associated with brain volume and WM hyperintensities in their study. This biological and neuroimaging evidence may suggest that SORL1 rs3824968 is associated with brain morphology in terms of A allele-related volumetric reduction caused by high Abeta load, cardiovascular disease, or both. However, additional studies are necessary to explore the potential mechanisms of SORL1 rs3824968 on the cellular and molecular determinants of brain structural differences in both demented and nondemented individuals."

SET SupportingText = "Sortilin receptor 1 (SORL1) is involved in cellular trafficking of amyloid precursor protein and plays an essential role in amyloid-beta peptide generation in Alzheimer disease (AD). The major A allele in a SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3824968, is associated with an increased AD risk. However, the role of SORL1 rs3824968 in the normal ageing process has rarely been examined in relation to brain structural morphology. This study investigated the association between SORL1 rs3824968 and grey matter (GM) volume in a nondemented Chinese population of 318 adults within a wide age range (21-92 years). Through voxel-based morphometry, we found that participants carrying SORL1 allele A exhibited significantly smaller GM volumes in the right posterior cingulate, left middle occipital, medial frontal, and superior temporal gyri. Considerable interaction between age and SORL1 suggested a detrimental and accelerated ageing effect of allele A on putamen. These findings provide evidence that SORL1 rs3824968 modulates regional GM volume and is associated with brain trajectory during the adult lifespan."
