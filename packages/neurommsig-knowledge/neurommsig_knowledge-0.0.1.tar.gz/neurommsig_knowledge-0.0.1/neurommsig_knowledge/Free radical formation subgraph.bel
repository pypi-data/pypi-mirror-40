SET SupportingText = "Antioxidant: The three histidine residues in ABeta¸ control the redox activity of iron, indicating that ABeta¸ is likely to be an important antioxidant. ABeta¸40 at 5 Ã‚ÂµM was found to protect primary neuronal cultures from the neurotoxicity of iron [94]. Nakamura et al. [177] found that ABeta¸40 or ABeta¸42 inhibits Fe3+ or Cu+2-catalyzed ascorbate oxidation and hydroxyl radical generation. Nanomolar concentrations of ABeta¸ can block neuronal apoptosis following oxidative damage, which suggests that ABeta¸ has a protective role against oxidative stress [178] and is essential for neuronal survival [28, 94]. Monomeric ABeta¸40 was found to protect neurons cultured in a medium containing 1.5 Ã‚ÂµM Fe2+ without antioxidant molecules. However, the antioxidant protection of monomeric ABeta¸40 depends on the type of oxidant used. ABeta¸40 inhibits cultured neurondeath caused by Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ but does not protect neurons against H2O2-induced damage [94]. In cerebral cortical neuronal cultures, monomeric ABeta¸40 inhibits the reduction of Fe3+ induced by vitamin C and the generation of superoxides and prevents lipid peroxidation induced by Fe2+ [94]. Moreover, monomeric forms of ABeta¸42 also exhibited antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. However, oligomeric or aggregated ABeta¸40 and ABeta¸42 were devoid of such antioxidant activity and their neuroprotective activity was demolished. Thus, depriving neurons of the protective activity of ABeta¸42 monomers may also be an important factor in neurodegeneration [97]. These findings provide novel insights on a normal antioxidant role of ABeta¸ and indicate that monomeric ABeta¸ protects neurons by quenching metal-inducible oxygen radical generation and thereby inhibits neurotoxicity."

Binding of Abeta to ABAD distorts the enzymebetas structure, rendering it inactive. In neurons, ABAD is predominately localized to mitochondria. Upon binding ABAD, Abeta triggers events leading to neuronal apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway.Interestingly, mitochondrial ABAD is upregulated in neurons from AD patients. The ABAD-Abeta complex has been hypothesized to induce oxidant stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased expression of ABAD exacerbates Abeta-mediated mitochondrial and neuronal stress. Abeta binding to ABAD causes free radical production and neuronal apoptotic process"
