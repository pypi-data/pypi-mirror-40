Mutation of residues in the CALM:SNARE interface inhibits binding in vitro and prevents R-SNARE endocytosis in vivo. Thus, CALM:R-SNARE interactions ensure that R-SNAREs, required for the fusion of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles with endosomes and also for subsequent postendosomal trafficking, are sorted into endocytic vesicles. CALM's role in directing the endocytosis of small R-SNAREs may provide insight into the association of CALM/PICALM mutations with growth retardation, cognitive defects, and Alzheimer's disease", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22118466"}, "annotations": {"Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Subgraph": {"Neurotransmitter release subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 1, "target": 0, "key": "5e160f5da2c96f711cc4a01ac5d87ad055e1ad0cce7959ba976b31e001b78f1fb9b112a924a6f2e95e42a9028ff29e89108a14d2f4cab4729ed841c5af706e27"}]}
