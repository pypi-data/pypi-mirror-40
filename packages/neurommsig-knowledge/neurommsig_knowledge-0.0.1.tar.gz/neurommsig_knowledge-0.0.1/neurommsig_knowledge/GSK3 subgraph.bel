SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with progressive dementia accompanied by three main structural changes in the brain: diffuse loss of neurons; intracellular protein deposits termed neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and extracellular protein deposits termed amyloid or senile plaques, surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Recent studies have suggested that the trafficking process of membrane associated proteins is modulated by the FAD-linked presenilin (PS) proteins, and that amyloid beta-peptide deposition may be initiated intracellularly, through the secretory pathway. Current hypotheses concerning presenilin function are based upon its cellular localization and its putative interaction as macromolecular complexes with the cell-adhesion/signaling beta-catenin molecule and the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) enzyme. Developmental studies have shown that PS proteins function as components in the Notch signal transduction cascade and that beta-catenin and GSK-3beta are transducers of the Wnt signaling pathway. Both pathways are thought to have an important role in brain development, and they have been connected through Dishevelled (Dvl) protein, a known transducer of the Wnt signaling pathway. In addition to a review of the current state of research on the subject, we present a cell signaling model in which a sustained loss of function of Wnt signaling components would trigger a series of misrecognition events, determining the onset and development of AD."

SET SupportingText = "Cerebrolysin is a peptide mixture with neurotrophic effects that might reduce the neurodegenerative pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrolysin might reduce amyloid deposition by regulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) degradation or by modulating APP expression, maturation, or processing. To investigate these possibilities, APP tg mice were treated for 6 months with Cerebrolysin and analyzed in the water maze, followed by RNA, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy analysis of full-length (FL) APP and its fragments, beta-secretase (BACE1), and Abeta-degrading enzymes [neprilysin (Nep) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)]. Consistent with previous studies, Cerebrolysin ameliorated the performance deficits in the spatial learning portion of the water maze and reduced the synaptic pathology and amyloid burden in the brains of APP tg mice. These effects were associated with reduced levels of FL APP and APP C-terminal fragments, but levels of BACE1, Notch1, Nep, and IDE were unchanged. In contrast, levels of active cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK-3beta; but not stress-activated protein kinase-1 (SAPK1)], kinases that phosphorylate APP, were reduced. Furthermore, Cerebrolysin reduced the levels of phosphorylated APP and the accumulation of APP in the neuritic processes. Taken together, these results suggest that Cerebrolysin might reduce AD-like pathology in the APP tg mice by regulating APP maturation and transport to sites where Abeta protein is generated."

SET SupportingText = "We have previously demonstrated that Leptin reduces extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) protein both in vitro and in vivo, and intracellular tau phosphorylation in vitro. Further, we have shown that these effects are dependent on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of AMPK signaling directly linked to tau phosphorylation. One such target, of relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be GSK-3beta, which has been shown to be inactivated by Leptin. We therefore dissected the role of GSK-3beta in mediating Leptin's ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Our data suggest that Leptin regulates tau phosphorylation through a pathway involving both AMPK and GSK-3beta. This was based on the following: Leptin and the cell-permeable AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), reduced tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant sites similarly to the GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Further, this reduction of tau phosphorylation was mimicked by the downregulation of GSK-3beta, achieved using siRNA technology and antagonized by the ectopic overexpression of GSK-3beta. "

Phosphorylation of GSK-3 and BAD inactivates these proteins and thereby inhibits further signaling leading to apoptosis. Activated AKT phosphorylates the forkhead transcription factor Foxo, which triggers its nuclear exclusion and thereby regulates transcription of genes involved in development, growth, stress resistance, apoptosis, metabolism and aging [29-31]. Several Foxo target genes might play an important role for the pathogenetics of AD (review in [32]): Catalase and MnSOD (manganese superoxid dismutase) are crucial in promoting longevity by possibly acting as antioxidants due to reduced insulin-like signaling in various species such as drosophila [33] and C. elegans [34].

Enzyme activity of both enzymes al ways changed in the same direction. This balÃÂ­ anced response seemed to induce a steady state in tau phosÃÂ­ phorylation at GSK-3/PP2A-dependent sites (115]. Thus, on ly a dysbalance of insulin/IGF-1 regulated tau kinases and phosphatases might lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, partially explaining the different resu lts obtained under different conditions."

SET SupportingText = "Rosiglitazone is a TZD derivative that was recently observed to improve cognition in both APP transgenic mice and AD patients [Watson et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 2006]. It activates PPARgamma leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Abeta neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in beta-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3beta is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARgamma by a potent ligand leads to beta-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARgamma activation in neuroprotection, PPARgamma agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARgamma activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARgamma in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005]. This study also showed that by decreasing Abeta secretion, PPARgamma protects the cells against H2O2-mediated necrosis [D'Abramo et al., 2005]."

SET SupportingText = "The PI3K/Akt signaling: PI3K, a membrane-associated second messenger protein, and its downstream kinase, Akt, are associated with neuronal survival [111] and plasticity [112] via activation of transcription pathways and protein synthesis. PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126]."

SET SupportingText = "Abeta-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer (AD) brains are surrounded by severe dendritic and axonal changes, including local spine loss, axonal swellings and distorted neurite trajectories. Whether and how plaques induce these neuropil abnormalities remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that oligomeric assemblies of Abeta, seen in the periphery of plaques, mediate the neurodegenerative phenotype of AD by triggering activation of the enzyme GSK-3beta, which in turn appears to inhibit a transcriptional program mediated by CREB. We detect increased activity of GSK-3beta after exposure to oligomeric Abeta in neurons in culture, in the brain of double transgenic APP/tau mice and in AD brains. Activation of GSK-3beta, even in the absence of Abeta, is sufficient to produce a phenocopy of Abeta-induced dendritic spine loss in neurons in culture, while pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3beta prevents spine loss and increases expression of CREB-target genes like BDNF. Of note, in transgenic mice GSK-3beta inhibition ameliorated plaque-related neuritic changes and increased CREB-mediated gene expression. Moreover, GSK-3beta inhibition robustly decreased the oligomeric Abeta load in the mouse brain. All these findings support the idea that GSK3beta is aberrantly activated by the presence of Abeta, and contributes, at least in part, to the neuronal anatomical derangement associated with Abeta plaques in AD brains and to Abeta pathology itself."

SET SupportingText = "In this in vitro study, we found that: (a) alpha-SN directly stimulates the phosphorylation of tau by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), (b) alpha-SN forms a heterotrimeric complex with tau and GSK-3beta, and (c) the nonamyloid beta component (NAC) domain and an acidic region of alpha-SN are responsible for the stimulation of GSK-3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. Thus, it is concluded that alpha-SN functions as a connecting mediator for tau and GSK-3beta, resulting in GSK-3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. Because the expression of alpha-SN is promoted by oxidative stress, the accumulation of alpha-SN induced by such stress may directly induce the hyperphosphorylation of tau by GSK-3beta. Furthermore, we found that heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) suppresses the alpha-SN-induced phosphorylation of tau by GSK-3beta through its direct binding to alpha-SN, suggesting that Hsp70 acts as a physiological suppressor of alpha-SN-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation."

SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of senile plaques of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Increasing APP gene dosage or expression has been shown to cause familial early-onset AD. However, whether and how protein stability of APP is regulated is unclear. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) have been shown to have the opposite effects on APP processing and Tau hyperphosphorylation, relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. However, nothing is known about their relationship. In this study, we found that Pin1 binds to the pT330-P motif in GSK3beta to inhibit its kinase activity. Furthermore, Pin1 promotes protein turnover of APP by inhibiting GSK3beta activity. A point mutation either at Thr-330, the Pin1-binding site in GSK3beta, or at Thr-668, the GSK3beta phosphorylation site in APP, abolished the regulation of GSK3beta activity, Thr-668 phosphorylation, and APP stability by Pin1, resulting in reduced non-amyloidogenic APP processing and increased APP levels. These results uncover a novel role of Pin1 in inhibiting GSK3beta kinase activity to reduce APP protein levels, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Pin1 protects against Alzheimer disease."

SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer disease, the most common tauopathy, is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles that are mainly composed of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Tau phosphorylation occurs mainly at proline-directed Ser/Thr sites, which are targeted by protein kinases such as GSK3beta and Cdk5. We reported previously that dephosphorylation of Tau at Cdk5-mediated sites was enhanced by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that stimulates dephosphorylation at proline-directed sites by protein phosphatase 2A. Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404). Furthermore, FTDP-17 mutant Tau (P301L or R406W) showed slightly weaker Pin1 binding than non-mutated Tau, suggesting that FTDP-17 mutations induce hyperphosphorylation by reducing the interaction between Pin1 and Tau."

SET SupportingText = "Taken together, our results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of donepezil against Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity are mediated through activation of PP2A, but its additional mechanisms including regulation of GSK-3beta and nAChRs activity would partially contribute to its effects. This observation led us to assume that additional mechanisms of donepezil, including its inhibitory effect on GSK-3beta activity and/or the activation role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), might be involved. Donepezil increased neuronal viability with reduced p-tau by enhancing PP2A activity."
