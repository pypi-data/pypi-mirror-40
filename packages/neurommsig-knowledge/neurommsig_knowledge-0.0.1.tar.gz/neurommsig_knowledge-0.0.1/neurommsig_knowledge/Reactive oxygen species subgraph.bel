SET SupportingText = "We have examined this by using oxidative stress to induce apoptosis in a mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT-22). Oxidatively modified proteins were measured by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with oxidation-specific immunostains.Under these conditions the oxidatively stressed cells undergo apoptotic process, and specific proteins are oxidized. The three proteins that appeared to be most susceptible to oxidation were identified by mass spectrometry. Those oxidized proteins are heat shock protein 60 and vimentin, both believed to function as antiapoptotic proteins, and a third protein with sequence homology to hemoglobin alpha-chain. When the cells were pretreated with vitamin E, these proteins were not oxidized and the cells did not undergo apoptotic process."

Dissecting the contribution of PLA2 to lipid peroxidation in cerebral ischemia is challenging due to multiple forms of PLA2, cardiolipin hydrolysis, diverse sources of ROS arising from arachidonic acid metabolism, catecholamine autoxidation, xanthine oxidase activity, mitochondrial dysfunction, activated neutrophils coupled with NADPH oxidase activity, and lack of specific inhibitors.

One is a direct pathway from death receptor (CD95, TNF-R1, and TRAIL-R1/TRAIL-R2 [9]) ligation to caspase cascade activation and cell death. Death receptor ligation triggers recruitment of the precursor form of caspase-8 to a death-inducing complex, through the adaptor protein FADD, which leads to caspase-8 activation. The other pathway triggered by stimuli such as drugs, radiation, infectious agents, and reactive oxygen species is initiated in mitochondria. After cytochrome c is released into the cytosol from the mitochondria, it binds to Apaf1 and ATP, which then activate caspase-9."

This leads to activation of several downstream targets, such as phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)-1, protein kinase B (PKB, AKT), p70S6kinase, glycogen synthase kinase(GSK)-3 and BAD a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Phosphorylation of GSK-3 and BAD inactivates these proteins and thereby inhibits further signaling leading to apoptosis. Activated AKT phosphorylates the forkhead transcription factor Foxo, which triggers its nuclear exclusion and thereby regulates transcription of genes involved in development, growth, stress resistance, apoptosis, metabolism and aging [29-31]. Several Foxo target genes might play an important role for the pathogenetics of AD (review in [32]): Catalase and MnSOD (manganese superoxid dismutase) are crucial in promoting longevity by possibly acting as antioxidants due to reduced insulin-like signaling in various species such as drosophila [33] and C. elegans [34].

From these deficiencies emerges the concept of synaptic energy exhaustion in AD, both phosphorylative (ATP) and redox (NAD[P]H) energies. Our previous work shows that hippocampal NAD(P)H and glutathione (GSH) decline with age in association with increased susceptibility to glutamate toxicity in neurons of old-age. Thus, an age-related decline in neuronal reducing currency (NAD[P]H) and reducing buffer (GSH) will surely promote oxidative stress and excess ROS. It is noteworthy that in the early stages of AD, there is already a reduction in the number of mitochondria and the activities of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes and cytochrome C oxidase. However, how ROS are produced at the synapse in response to Abeta oligomers is not fully known."

Upon binding ABAD, Abeta triggers events leading to neuronal apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway.Interestingly, mitochondrial ABAD is upregulated in neurons from AD patients. The ABAD-Abeta complex has been hypothesized to induce oxidant stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased expression of ABAD exacerbates Abeta-mediated mitochondrial and neuronal stress.

In addition to being an anti-glutamatergic agent, riluzole also has antioxidant effects and can protect dopaminergic neurons against oxidative stress by reducing lipid peroxidation and ATP consumption [19, 27, 35, 36].
