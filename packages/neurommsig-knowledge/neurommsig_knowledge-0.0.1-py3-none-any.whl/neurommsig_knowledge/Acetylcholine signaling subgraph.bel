SET SupportingText = "The results of the present study, thus, suggest that nefiracetam enhances activity of nicotinic ACh receptors by interacting with a PKC pathway, thereby increasing glutamate release from presynaptic terminals, and then leading to a sustained facilitation of hippocampal neurotransmission. This may represent a cellular mechanism underlying the cognition-enhancing action of nefiracetam. The results also provide the possibility that nefiracetam could be developed as a promising therapeutic drug for senile dementia or Alzheimer's disease."

In particular the ability of galanin to inhibit acetylcholine release, along with the observation of hyperinervation of galanin fibres in the human basal forebrain of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggest a possible role for galanin in the cholinergic dysfunction, characteristic of the disease. Moreover, galanin has been suggested to be involved in other neuronal functions, such as learning and memory, epileptic activity, nociception, spinal reflexes and feeding.

Despite its name CDK5 does not affect the cell division cycle; it is expressed postmitotically, and its function is related to cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, cell differentiation, and exocytosis (14) instead of cellular proliferation. Recently, Pho-85, a yeast ortholog of CDK5, was shown to be involved in metabolic control by regulating different steps of glycogen and phosphate metabolism (13). Expression of CDK5 in insulin-producing cells is not surprising because widespread expression of this kinase has been described. CDK5 expression in beta-cells has also been reported (24)."

AChE is synthesized as an inactive precursor and then matures into an active subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum [32]. Thus, the other explanation was that AChE could be exposed to cytoplasm when endoplasmic reticulum was destroyed by H2O2. At least one protein kinase (protein kinase A , PKA), was reported to increase the AChE activity by phosphorylation at non-consensus sites of this enzyme [33]. The apoptotic stimuli also enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of AChE in cells without background AChE expression, which were mediated by calcium signalling or the c-Jun kinase pathway"

Glutathione, which is involved in cellular redox homeostasis, inhibited the increase of AChE activity, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in this process. Further investigation showed that the elevation of AChE was observed after the degradation of Akt, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of caspase family members. When nerve growth factor (NGF) was present, with the maintenance of Akt level, the elevation of AChE, the cytochrome c diffusion, as well as apoptotic process were markedly attenuated in H2O2-treated PC12 cells"

SET SupportingText = "Dysregulation of intracellular calcium signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AlzheimerÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s disease [150]. ABetaÂ¸ is known to act through multiple targets [151] including Ca2+ channels and various receptors in membranes. Synthetic ABetaÂ¸ binds to the calcium permeable nAChRs with high affinity [152]. ABetaÂ¸42 administered in the low picomolar range activates nAChRs at presynaptic nerve endings of synaptosomes [83, 153]. Under normal conditions, activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABetaÂ¸-induced increase in synaptic plasticity and memory [23]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the peptide with the nAChR. In addition, ABetaÂ¸ enhances transmitter release by transient increase of glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal that results from brief periods of high frequency stimulation with Ca2+ buildup within the terminal that triggers mechanisms of short-term synaptic plasticity [154]."

SET SupportingText = "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Activation of the neuronal pentameric nAChRs is involved in diverse brain functions including synaptic plasticity and memory [237, 238] and enhances transmitter release in several brain regions including the hippocampus [239], the spinal cord dorsal horn [240], the olfactory bulb, and the amygdala [241]. The increase of synaptic plasticity by ABetaÂ¸ requires activation of nAChRs [242]. Because activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABetaÂ¸-induced increase of synaptic plasticity and memory under normal conditions, ABetaÂ¸ may modify glutamate release with a mechanism dependent upon activation of nAChRs [83]. However, several reports of the effect of ABetaÂ¸42 on nAChRs are conflicting. Some studies have reported that ABetaÂ¸42 activates nAChRs [243, 244], while others indicate that ABetaÂ¸42 inhibits nAChRs [245, 246]. Interestingly, picomolar concentrations of ABetaÂ¸42 were effective in activating nAChRs while higher levels of ABetaÂ¸ produced inhibitory action. The disparity may depend on the nanomolar ABetaÂ¸1ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢â¬Å42 inhibition of nicotine-induced Ca2+ responses while picomolar ABetaÂ¸42 directly evokes sustained increases in presynaptic Ca2+ via nAChRs [244]. ABetaÂ¸42 binds to the nAChR with picomolar affinity [247]. This binding can modulate presynaptic, glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission or glutamate release, suggesting that ABetaÂ¸42-dependent cholinergic modulation activates signal transduction mechanisms that ultimately result in synaptic transmission and memory consolidation [248]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the ABetaÂ¸ peptide with the nAChRs. Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic AD brains show that ABetaÂ¸42 and nAChR, are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons suggesting that ABetaÂ¸ could be tightly associated with nAChR [247]. Alternatively, ABetaÂ¸ might be responsible for regulation of nAChR function through strong binding with membrane lipids [249]. Picomolar or higher ABetaÂ¸42 acting through nAChRs, can elicit ERK MAPK activation in hippocampal cultures [245, 250] possibly triggered by Ca2+ influx [243, 251]. ERK is known to regulate transcription factors such as CREB and Elk-1 by phosphorylation [140], which help initiate transcription of memory-associated genes that contain their respective regulatory elements [252]. Therefore, over-activation of nAChRs and excessive Ca2+ influx or dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis provide a molecular mechanism for the cholinergic dysfunction that is a hallmark of AD [253, 254]."
