SET SupportingText = "it has been demonstrated that micromolar S100B concentrations stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation through the receptor for advanced glycation ending products, and subsequently activate nuclear AP-1/cJun transcription, in cultured human neural stem cells. In addition, as revealed by Western blot, small interfering RNA and immunofluorescence analysis, S100B-induced JNK activation increased expression of Dickopff-1 that, in turn, promoted glycogen synthase kinase 3beta phosphorylation and beta-catenin degradation, causing canonical Wnt signaling pathway disruption and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. These findings propose a previously unrecognized link between S100B and tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting S100B can contribute to NFT formation in AD and in all other conditions in which neuroinflammation may have a crucial role."
