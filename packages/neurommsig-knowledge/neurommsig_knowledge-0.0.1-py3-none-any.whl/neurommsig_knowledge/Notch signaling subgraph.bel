SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with progressive dementia accompanied by three main structural changes in the brain: diffuse loss of neurons; intracellular protein deposits termed neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and extracellular protein deposits termed amyloid or senile plaques, surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Recent studies have suggested that the trafficking process of membrane associated proteins is modulated by the FAD-linked presenilin (PS) proteins, and that amyloid beta-peptide deposition may be initiated intracellularly, through the secretory pathway. Current hypotheses concerning presenilin function are based upon its cellular localization and its putative interaction as macromolecular complexes with the cell-adhesion/signaling beta-catenin molecule and the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) enzyme. Developmental studies have shown that PS proteins function as components in the Notch signal transduction cascade and that beta-catenin and GSK-3beta are transducers of the Wnt signaling pathway. Both pathways are thought to have an important role in brain development, and they have been connected through Dishevelled (Dvl) protein, a known transducer of the Wnt signaling pathway. In addition to a review of the current state of research on the subject, we present a cell signaling model in which a sustained loss of function of Wnt signaling components would trigger a series of misrecognition events, determining the onset and development of AD."

SET SupportingText = "Recently, Notch receptors have been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegeneration and in particular in Alzheimer's disease (Notch1) and CADASIL (Notch3). Here we show that another family member (Notch2) is constitutively expressed in adult mouse hippocampus in DG and not in CA1 and CA3 neurons. Treatment with kainic acid resulted in marked Notch2 induction in pyramidal neurons of CA1 and in a subpopulation of CA3 neurons surviving the lesion and protein expression was still detectable 6 weeks after drug treatment. These results suggest Notch2 involvement in the response of postmitotic neurons to excitotoxic stimuli."

SET SupportingText = "Cerebrolysin is a peptide mixture with neurotrophic effects that might reduce the neurodegenerative pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrolysin might reduce amyloid deposition by regulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) degradation or by modulating APP expression, maturation, or processing. To investigate these possibilities, APP tg mice were treated for 6 months with Cerebrolysin and analyzed in the water maze, followed by RNA, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy analysis of full-length (FL) APP and its fragments, beta-secretase (BACE1), and Abeta-degrading enzymes [neprilysin (Nep) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)]. Consistent with previous studies, Cerebrolysin ameliorated the performance deficits in the spatial learning portion of the water maze and reduced the synaptic pathology and amyloid burden in the brains of APP tg mice. These effects were associated with reduced levels of FL APP and APP C-terminal fragments, but levels of BACE1, Notch1, Nep, and IDE were unchanged. In contrast, levels of active cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK-3beta; but not stress-activated protein kinase-1 (SAPK1)], kinases that phosphorylate APP, were reduced. Furthermore, Cerebrolysin reduced the levels of phosphorylated APP and the accumulation of APP in the neuritic processes. Taken together, these results suggest that Cerebrolysin might reduce AD-like pathology in the APP tg mice by regulating APP maturation and transport to sites where Abeta protein is generated."

SET SupportingText = " To investigate potential homodimeric and heterodimeric interactions of APP and Notch2 (N2), we have visualized the subcellular localization of the APP/N2 complexes formed in living cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis. BiFC was accomplished by fusing the N-terminal fragment or the C-terminal fragment of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to APP, N2, and a C-terminally truncated form of N2.When expressed in COS-7 cells, these tagged proteins alone did not produce a fluorescent signal. The tagged APP homodimer produced a weak fluorescent signal, while neither full-length N2, nor a truncated N2 alone, produced a visible signal, suggesting that N2 receptors do not form homodimers. The strongest fluorescent signal was obtained with co-expression of the C-terminal fragment of YFP fused to APP and the N-terminal fragment of YFP fused to the truncated form of N2. This heterodimer localized to plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi and other compartments. The results were confirmed and quantified by flow cytometry. The BiFC method of specifically visualizing APP/Notch interactions can be applied to study APP and Notch signaling during development, aging and neurodegeneration."

Oligo microarray and RT-PCR analysis further clarified that the neurotrophic effect of liquiritin was related to the overexpression of neural related genes such as neurogenin 3, neurofibromatosis 1, notch gene homolog 2, neuromedin U receptor 2 and neurotrophin 5. Thus, liquiritin may be a good candidate for treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease."

SET SupportingText = " The amyloid precursor protein is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that has been long implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease but its normal biological function has remained elusive despite extensive effort. We have previously reported the identification of Notch2 as an amyloid precursor protein interacting protein in E18 rat neurons. Here, we sought to reveal the physiologic consequences of this interaction. We report a functional relationship between amyloid precursor protein and Notch1, which does not affect Delta ligand binding. First, we observed interactions between the amyloid precursor protein and Notch in mouse embryonic stem cells lacking both presenilin 1 and presenilin 2, the active proteolytic components of the gamma-secretase complex, suggesting that these two transmembrane proteins can interact in the absence of presenilin. Next, we demonstrated that the amyloid precursor protein affects Notch signaling by using Notch-dependent luciferase assays in two cell lines, the human embryonic kidney 293 and the monkey kidney, COS7. We found that the amyloid precursor protein exerts opposing effects on Notch signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 vs. COS7 cells. Finally, we show that more Notch Intracellular Domain is found in the nucleus in the presence of exogenous amyloid precursor protein or its intracellular domain, suggesting the mechanism by which the amyloid precursor protein affects Notch signaling in certain cells. Our results provide evidence of potentially important communications between the amyloid precursor protein and Notch."

SET SupportingText = "Notch signaling has been shown to control cell fate through local cell-to-cell interactions. During development, Notch suppresses neuronal differentiation in vivo and in vitro (Geling et al., 2004; Kabos et al., 2002). When ligands bind Notch, proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors occurs by the gamma-secretase/nicastrin complex to release the signal-transducing Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (Yu et al., 2000). Cleaved NICDs translocate into the nucleus and interact with a nuclear protein named CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1 (CSL) (Schroeter et al., 1998). The CSL and NICD complex activates expression of primary target genes of Notch, such as Hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) gene families (Jarriault et al., 1998). Following activation, Hes suppresses expression of transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, such as Mash1 and NeuroD (Pleasure et al., 2000). Notch activation is reported to strengthen glial differentiation by crosstalk to IL-6 signaling pathways, which is a known central regulator of gliogenesis. IL-6 cytokine signaling activation induces subsequent phosphorylation of gp130, Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Kamakura et al., 2004). Upon Notch activation, increased Hes is known to facilitate complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, promoting STAT3 phosphorylation. This facilitates accessibility of STAT3 to the DNA binding element of the GFAP promoter. In the present study, we demonstrate APP may induce glial differentiation of NPCs through activation of the Notch signaling pathway."

NICD formation depends on gamma-secretase complex as the AICD fragment of AbetaPP.

Analysis revealed that expression levels of HES1, HES2, and HEY1 increased"
