SET SupportingText = "The results of the present study, thus, suggest that nefiracetam enhances activity of nicotinic ACh receptors by interacting with a PKC pathway, thereby increasing glutamate release from presynaptic terminals, and then leading to a sustained facilitation of hippocampal neurotransmission. This may represent a cellular mechanism underlying the cognition-enhancing action of nefiracetam. The results also provide the possibility that nefiracetam could be developed as a promising therapeutic drug for senile dementia or Alzheimer's disease."

The stable expression of 17A in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells induces the synthesis of an alternative splicing isoform that abolish GABA B2 intracellular signaling (i.e., inhibition of cAMP accumulation and activation of K(+) channels). Indeed, 17A is expressed in human brain, and we report that it is upregulated in cerebral tissues derived from Alzheimer disease patients. We demonstrate that 17A expression in neuroblastoma cells enhances the secretion of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and the Abeta x-42/Ãâbeta x-40 peptide ratio and that its synthesis is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli."

SET SupportingText = "The nootropic compound nefiracetam was evaluated in 88 older rabbits in a 750-ms delay paradigm of eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC). Nefiracetam facilitated acquisition of EBCC in older rabbits. EBCC is performed poorly by older humans and is seriously impaired in Alzheimer's disease. These preclinical data in an animal model with clear parallels in humans suggest that nefiracetam may prove effective as a cognition enhancer in clinical trials."
