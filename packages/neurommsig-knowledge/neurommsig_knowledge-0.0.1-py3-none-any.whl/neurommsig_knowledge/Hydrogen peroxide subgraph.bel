SET SupportingText = "AChE activity was reported to be enhanced by low concentrations of H2O2. explanation is that mitochondrial efflux H2O2 modifies membrane structure through lipid peroxidation, and therefore contributes to modify the activity of the membrane-bound protein AChE [31]. AChE is synthesized as an inactive precursor and then matures into an active subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum [32]. Thus, the other explanation was that AChE could be exposed to cytoplasm when endoplasmic reticulum was destroyed by H2O2. At least one protein kinase (protein kinase A , PKA), was reported to increase the AChE activity by phosphorylation at non-consensus sites of this enzyme [33]. The apoptotic stimuli also enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of AChE in cells without background AChE expression, which were mediated by calcium signalling or the c-Jun kinase pathway"

Our results showed that H2O2 induced AChE activity, a functional marker in apoptotic process, increases in neuronal-like PC12 cells. Glutathione, which is involved in cellular redox homeostasis, inhibited the increase of AChE activity, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in this process. Further investigation showed that the elevation of AChE was observed after the degradation of Akt, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of caspase family members. When nerve growth factor (NGF) was present, with the maintenance of Akt level, the elevation of AChE, the cytochrome c diffusion, as well as apoptotic process were markedly attenuated in H2O2-treated PC12 cells"

SET SupportingText = "The present investigation reports that clinically relevant concentrations of tarenflurbil (i.e., 1-5 microM) protect both cultured human neuroblastoma cell lines and primary neurons from cytotoxicity associated with exposure to Abeta_{42} or H_{2}O_{2}. In concert with this protection, there is an upregulation of neurotrophins [i.e., nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)]. Furthermore, blocking exogenous NGF or BDNF by binding it to antibody prevents tarenflurbil from protecting human neuronal cells from Abeta_{42} and H_{2}O_{2} cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that up-regulation of neurotrophins might represent an underlying mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects seen with tarenflurbil in AD."
