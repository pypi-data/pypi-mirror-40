Oxidatively modified proteins were measured by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with oxidation-specific immunostains.Under these conditions the oxidatively stressed cells undergo apoptotic process, and specific proteins are oxidized. The three proteins that appeared to be most susceptible to oxidation were identified by mass spectrometry. Those oxidized proteins are heat shock protein 60 and vimentin, both believed to function as antiapoptotic proteins, and a third protein with sequence homology to hemoglobin alpha-chain. When the cells were pretreated with vitamin E, these proteins were not oxidized and the cells did not undergo apoptotic process."

SET SupportingText = "Apoptosis pathways and DNA synthesis are activated in neurons in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the signaling mechanisms that mediate these events have not been defined. We show that expression of familial AD (FAD) mutants of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in primary neurons in culture causes apoptosis and DNA synthesis. Both the apoptosis and the DNA synthesis are mediated by the p21 activated kinase PAK3, a serine-threonine kinase that interacts with APP. A dominant-negative kinase mutant of PAK3 inhibits the neuronal apoptosis and DNA synthesis; this effect is abolished by deletion of the PAK3 APP-binding domain or by coexpression of a peptide representing this binding domain. The involvement of PAK3 specifically in FAD APP-mediated apoptosis rather than in general apoptotic pathways is suggested by the facts that a dominant-positive mutant of PAK3 does not alone cause neuronal apoptosis and that the dominant-negative mutant of PAK3 does not inhibit chemically induced apoptotic process."

SET SupportingText = "Thus, we addressed this paradoxical condition of AD in rat neurons treated with okadaic acid (OA) which inhibits protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) and induces tau hyperphosphorylation and cell death. Interestingly, OA also induces phosphorylation of GSK3beta at serine-9 and other substrates including tau, beta-catenin and CRMP2 like in AD brains. In this context, we observed that GSK3beta inhibitors such as lithium chloride and 6-bromoindirubin-3'-monoxime (6-BIO) reversed those phosphorylation events and protected neurons. These data suggest that GSK3beta may still have its kinase activity despite increase of its phosphorylation at serine-9 in AD brains at least in PP2A-compromised conditions and that GSK3beta inhibitors could be a valuable drug candidate in AD."

One is a direct pathway from death receptor (CD95, TNF-R1, and TRAIL-R1/TRAIL-R2 [9]) ligation to caspase cascade activation and cell death. Death receptor ligation triggers recruitment of the precursor form of caspase-8 to a death-inducing complex, through the adaptor protein FADD, which leads to caspase-8 activation. The other pathway triggered by stimuli such as drugs, radiation, infectious agents, and reactive oxygen species is initiated in mitochondria. After cytochrome c is released into the cytosol from the mitochondria, it binds to Apaf1 and ATP, which then activate caspase-9."

The permeabilization of the lysosome has been shown to initiate a cell death pathway in specific circumstances. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) causes the release of cathepsins and other hydrolases from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. LMP is a potentially lethal event because the ectopic presence of lysosomal proteases in the cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation of additional hydrolases including caspases. This latter process is usually mediated indirectly, through a cascade in which LMP causes the proteolytic activation of Bid (which is cleaved by the two lysosomal cathepsins B and D). The Bid activation then induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting in cytochrome c release and apoptosome-dependent caspase activation [19]. However, massive LMP often results in cell death without caspase activation, which may adopt a subapoptotic or necrotic appearance. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax can translocate from the cytosol to lysosomal membranes and induce LMP"

ERK-1/-2 mediated signals are involved in I?n -lasting neuronal plasticity, including long-term potenÃÂ­ tiatiOn and memory consolidation (review in [38]). In conÃÂ­ trast, (over-)activation of ERK-1 /-2 also leads to apoptotic eeldeath i.n cae of oxidative stress or growth factor depriÃÂ­ vation (review m [39]). However, ERKs seems to be an esÃÂ­ sential gene since animals lacking ERK-2 die in early emÃÂ­ bryonic development (40]."

Properly controlled homeostasis of calcium signaling not only supports normal brain physiology but also maintains neuronal integrity and long-term cell survival. Ca2+ signaling pathways can suppress apoptosis and promote survival through two mechanistically distinct processes. One process involves the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway which promotes survival [147].

Subsequently, it was demonstrated that seladin-1 has also enzymatic activity [3-beta-hydroxysterol delta-24-reductase, (DHCR24)], which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. The amount of membrane cholesterol may play an important role both in protecting neuronal cells against toxic insults and in inhibiting the production of beta-amyloid. We demonstrated that seladin-1 overexpression increases the amount of membrane cholesterol and induces resistance against beta-amyloid aggregates in neuroblastoma cells, whereas a specific inhibitor of DHCR24 increased cell vulnerability. We also hypothesized that seladin-1 might be a mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogens. We first demonstrated that, in human fetal neuroepithelial cells (FNC), 17beta-estradiol, raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert protective effects against beta-amyloid toxicity and oxidative stress. In addition, these molecules significantly increased the expression of seladin-1 and the amount of cell cholesterol. Then, we showed that, upon seladin-1 silencing, the protective effects of estrogens were abolished, thus indicating this factor as a fundamental mediator of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection, at least in FNC cells. Furthermore, we detected the presence of functionally active half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream the coding region of the seladin-1 gene. Overall, our results indicate that seladin-1 may be viewed as a multi-faceted protein, which conjugates both the neuroprotective properties of estrogens and the important functions of cholesterol in maintaining brain homeostasis"

Whether and how plaques induce these neuropil abnormalities remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that oligomeric assemblies of Abeta, seen in the periphery of plaques, mediate the neurodegenerative phenotype of AD by triggering activation of the enzyme GSK-3beta, which in turn appears to inhibit a transcriptional program mediated by CREB. We detect increased activity of GSK-3beta after exposure to oligomeric Abeta in neurons in culture, in the brain of double transgenic APP/tau mice and in AD brains. Activation of GSK-3beta, even in the absence of Abeta, is sufficient to produce a phenocopy of Abeta-induced dendritic spine loss in neurons in culture, while pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3beta prevents spine loss and increases expression of CREB-target genes like BDNF. Of note, in transgenic mice GSK-3beta inhibition ameliorated plaque-related neuritic changes and increased CREB-mediated gene expression. Moreover, GSK-3beta inhibition robustly decreased the oligomeric Abeta load in the mouse brain. All these findings support the idea that GSK3beta is aberrantly activated by the presence of Abeta, and contributes, at least in part, to the neuronal anatomical derangement associated with Abeta plaques in AD brains and to Abeta pathology itself."

SET SupportingText = "Another relevant role for PSs is Notch processing. Notch signaling is involved in cell fate regulation, cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis as well as neurodegeneration. Notch is a membrane receptor whose C-terminal domain (NICD), upon interaction with appropriate ligands, translocates into the nucleus where it activates the CSL family of transcription factors. NICD formation depends on gamma-secretase complex as the AICD fragment of AbetaPP. PSs play a role in apoptotic process, since FAD mutants cause cell death or induce secondary events that may lead to apoptotic process .Animals, in which PS1 and PS2 genes are deleted, show deficit in learning, memory, synaptic function and neuronal death. The processes beneath these effects are unknown, but the findings that PS1 interacts with antiapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family might indicate a possible mechanism."
