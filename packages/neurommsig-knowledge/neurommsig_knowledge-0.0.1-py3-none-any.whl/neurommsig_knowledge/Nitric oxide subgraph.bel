SET SupportingText = "It has been shown that apoE increased the production of nitric oxide (NO) from human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM); this effect could represent an important link between tissue redox balance and inflammation, since inflammation and oxidative stress are involved in chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, it has been evidenced that an overproduction of NO in the central nervous system (CNS) may play a key role in aging and that the glial cells (microglials cells and probably astrocytes) are able to form consistent amounts of NO through the induction of a nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) isoform so-called inducible or inflammatory.We observed a decreased NO production after incubation with both LDL and HDL and an increased peroxynitrite production. As it concerns NOS expression, densitometric analysis of bands indicated that iNOS protein levels were significantly higher in the cells incubated with both AD lipoproteins and offspring lipoproteins compared to cells incubated with control lipoproteins. These findings suggest the possibility to identify in NO pathway a precocious marker of AD."

Uncontrolled activation of ionotropic receptors leads to an excessive influx of calcium through the plasma membrane, which along with impairments of synaptic activation and neuronal plasticity, activate a number of calcium-dependent enzymes involved in the catabolism of proteins, phospholipids, and nucleic acids, as well as in the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO).These alterations can potentially lead to cell death through different pathways, such as membrane break-down, cytoskeletal alterations, and NO-derived free radical production."

SET SupportingText = "In the first stage of this study a total of 152 SNPs were screened (Table S6). All SNPs did not significantly deviate from HardyÃ¢â¬âWeinberg equilibrium proportions in controls, 10 SNPs deviated in cases. 39 SNPs dropped out prior to analysis due to monomorphism (nÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°8), genotyping failure (nÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°21), not biallelic (nÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°2) and a MAFÃ¢â¬â°<Ã¢â¬â°0.05 (nÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°8). A total of 113 SNPs were analyzed for association with disease status in the overall sample, and 6 SNPs in 5 different genes showed significant association with disease status under at least one genetic model (Table I). Both SNPs within SOS2 were significantly associated with disease status, with the remaining positive SNPs located within RPS6KA2 (Gene ID 6196), HNF4A (Gene ID 3172), PPP1CC (Gene ID 5501), and PCK1. Additional analysis of the data stratified by APOE genotype provided evidence of association for 15 SNPs in either the APOE Îµ4 positive or APOE Îµ4 negative sample sets (Table I). Two of these SNPs were associated in the overall Stage 1 sample; SNP 139 (HNF4A) and SNP 150 (PCK1), and it was observed that these SNPs had a greater effect when stratified by APOE genotype: OR 0.5 versus 0.63; OR 2.11 versus 1.54, respectively. Two further PCK1 SNPs (SNP 144 and SNP 149) showed marginal association in the APOE Îµ4 positive samples (PÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.07, 0.09). In addition, there was evidence of positive association for both PPARgamma polymorphisms (SNP 65 and SNP 66) in the APOE Îµ4 positive sample set. Allele 2 of both of these SNPs (G and T, respectively) appeared to protect against disease (ORÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.5, ORÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.45). The result obtained with the major allele of SNP 52 within INSR (Gene ID 3643), allele A, was also suggestive of a protective factor (ORÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.5; APOE Îµ4 negative samples). A further SNP from INSR, SNP 48, showed a trend toward association, but this result was observed in the APOE Îµ4 positive samples (PÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.06). SNP 20 from the ENPP1 gene (Gene ID 5167) showed evidence for association in both the APOE Îµ4 positive and Îµ4 negative samples. A final 7 SNPs showed evidence of association in the APOE Îµ4 positive samples, SNP 34 (INPPL1 Gene ID 3636), SNP 62 (HK2 Gene ID 3099), SNP 93 (NOS3 Gene ID 4846), and in the APOE Îµ4 negative samples, SNP 72 (GC Gene ID 2638), SNP 94 (ADRB3 Gene ID 155), SNP 130 (CETP Gene ID 1071), and SNP 136 (PPP2R1A Gene ID 5518). Following correction using the False Discovery Rate Procedure (FDR) at a variety of levels, however, the majority of these results could be rejected as false discoveries (Table S8)."
