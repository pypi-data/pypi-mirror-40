title: New command to list all issues
desc: |-
  I would like to see a list of all issues, but there is not command for
  that.
  
  - `todo` lists unreleased releases, not all issues.
  - `status` gives a summary of issues.
  - `log` and `shortlog` lists what has happened.
  
  Workaround is to use `grep` command, for example 
  
      grep .*
  
  but that is not very intuitive.

    I implemented a simple list command as a plugin.
    See `ditz/plugins/list.py`

  - Documentation and tests for list command is missing.

    Decided to merge `list` with `grep`, and have a single `list` command
    which takes an optional regexp.
