title: Line wrapping problem in terminal
desc: |-
  Bitbucket issue #6:
  
    If the title of an issue is longer than the terminal width it wraps,
    and this adds an extra line to the terminal output causing the
    "more/less" feature to lose lines off of the top of the screen.  I can
    scroll up, but if I'm trying to work with mainly a keyboard it is a
    pain.

    Reproduced the problem, by shrinking the terminal window.  There are
    two main options: (1) truncate the line, or (2) recognize when it's
    wrapped and update lines printed accordingly.  The first would look
    nicer, but lose information.

    Truncation has to be done up front, before any encoding or highlighting
    happens, or Bad Things will happen.

    Handle long lines, either by wrapping (the default) or truncation (via
    config file setting).
