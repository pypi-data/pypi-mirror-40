  - IPython is probably doing 'clever' stuff behind the scenes, but what?

    IPython can exhibit these behaviors when used as an embedded component. I
    recently encountered this on a third-party application which embedded the
    current version of IPython. Reproducing the issue was problematic. Our
    resolution was to use IPython as the interpreter, not an embedded component.
