        # Soothing Sounds Generator
        
        
        An acoustically pleasing Python code, targeted initially for Raspberry Pi, but should run almost anywhere. 
        Uses lightweight, pure Python
        [SoundDevice](https://pypi.org/project/sounddevice/)
        to generate sounds.
        Optionally, other sound playback Python packages can be used.
        
        I have used the outputs of this program written to SD cards, played on media players in multiple locations for a few years.
        
        ## Install
        
            pip install -e .
        
        ## Usage
        
        The noise `color` option is one of
        
        > white pink blue violet brown
        
        the examples will use pink noise.
        
        ### Play sound from speakers
        
            python soothing.py pink
        
        ### save sound to disk
        
        
        1. generate raw sound file: `python soothing.py pink -o pink.raw`
        2. convert raw to lossless FLAC (playable in almost all media players, computer, phone etc.)
           ```bash
           ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 -i pink.raw pink.fla
           ``` 
        
        
        ## Notes
        
        The core noise generation code is almost entirely from 
        [Python Acoustics](https://github.com/python-acoustics/python-acoustics)
        
        ### optional high performance Python FFTW install:
        
        ```sh
        apt install libfftw3-dev
        ```
