    Represents a joystick event as a :func:`~collections.namedtuple`. The
    fields of the event are defined below:

    .. attribute:: timestamp

        A :class:`~datetime.datetime` object specifying when the event took
        place. This timestamp is derived from the kernel event so it should be
        accurate even when callbacks have taken time reacting to events. The
        timestamp is a naive :class:`~datetime.datetime` object in local time.

    .. attribute:: direction

        A string indicating which direction the event pertains to. Can be one
        of "up", "down", "left ∫, "right", or "enter" (the last event refers to
        the joystick being pressed inward).

    .. attribute:: pressed

        A bool which is ``True`` when the event indicates that the joystick is
        being pressed *or held* in the specified direction. When this is
        ``False``, the event indicates that the joystick has been released from
        the specified direction.

    .. attribute:: held

        A bool which is ``True`` when the event indicates that the joystick
        direction is currently held down (when :attr:`pressed` is also
        ``True``) or that the direction was *previously* held down (when
        :attr:`pressed` is ``False`` buut :attr:`held` is still ``True``).
    """

class SenseStick(object):
    """
    The :class:`SenseStick` class represents the joystick on the Sense HAT.
    Users can either instantiate this class themselves, or can access an
    instance from :attr:`SenseHAT.stick`.

    The :meth:`read` method can be called to obtain :class:`StickEvent`
    instances, or the instance can be treated as an iterator in which case
    events will be yielded as they come in::

        hat = SenseHAT()
        for event in hat.stick:
            if event.pressed and not event.held:
                print('%s pressed!' % event.direction)

    Alternatively, handler functions can be assigned to the attributes
    :attr:`when_up`, :attr:`when_down`, :attr:`when_left`, :attr:`when_right`,
    :attr:`when_enter`. The assigned functions will be called when any matching
    event occurs.

    Finally, the attributes :attr:`up`, :attr:`down`, :attr:`left`,
    :attr:`right`, and attr:`enter` can be polled to determine the current
    state of the joystick.

    The :attr:`rotation` attribute can be modified to alter the orientation of
    events, and the aforementioned attributes.

    The *max_events* parameter controls the size of the internal queue used to
    buffer joystick events. This defaults to 100 which should be more than
    sufficient to ensure events are not lost. The *flush_input* parameter,
    which defaults to ``True`` controls whether, when the instance is closed,
    it attempts to flush the stdin of the owning terminal. This is useful as
    the joystick also acts as a keyboard. On the command line, this can mean
    that joystick movements (buffered during a script's execution) can
    inadvertently execute historical commands (e.g. Up a few times followed by
    Enter).

    Finally, if the *emulate* parameter is ``True``, the instance will connect
    to the joystick in the `desktop Sense HAT emulator`_ instead of the "real"
    Sense HAT joystick.
