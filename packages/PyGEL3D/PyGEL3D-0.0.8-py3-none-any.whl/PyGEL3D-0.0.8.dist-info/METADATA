# PyGEL

GEL is a library for geometry processing, and PyGEL provides Python bindings to a large subset of GEL.

Probably, the pivotal feature of GEL and PyGEL is the halfedge based mesh representation. Quite a few
algorithms are implemented on top of the mesh representation: simplification, triangulation of polygons,
optimization through edge flipping, subdivision, distance to mesh computation, etc. PyGEL also provides 
an efficient kd tree and a mesh viewer which supports annotation points.
