Description: 
        Image processors and filters, inspired by Instagram, and ready for use
        with django-imagekit.
        
        Included are filters for Atkinson-dither halftoning,  dot-pitch halftoning
        (with GCR and per-channel pipeline processors), classes for Numpy-based
        image processors, Gaussian kernel functions, processors for applying curves
        to images from Photoshop .acv files, imagekit-ready processors exposing
        Pillowâ€™s many image adjustment algorithms (e.g. noise and blur functions,
        histogram-based adjustments like Brightness/Contrast, and many others),
        and an implementation of the entropy-based smart-crop algorithm that many
        know from the easy-thumbnails Django app.
        
        Experienced users may also make use of the many utilities shipping with
        instakit: LUT maps, color structs, pipeline processing primitives and 
        ink-based separation simulation tools, and other related miscellany.
