            pip install apache2-vh
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can see all the commands and basic usage typing:

            usage: vh server_name folder_name [-h] [-m2] [-a SERVER_ALIAS] [-d DIRECTORY_ROOT] [-p PORT] [-c CONF_NAME]

        But you have a few more optional arguments:
