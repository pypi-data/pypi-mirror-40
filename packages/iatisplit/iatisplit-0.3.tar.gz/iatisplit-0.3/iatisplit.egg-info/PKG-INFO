Description: Parsing very-large XML files into an in-memory DOM can cause a memory-usage
        explosion that shuts down even a large server. This streaming library is optimised to handle very 
        large IATI activity reports and split them into smaller XML documents that a system can import
        individually. It can load the IATI activity reports either from a local file or direct download
        from a (public) URL. Memory usage is relatively constant regardless of the source-file size, so it 
        is entirely reasonable to process 100+ MB XML files, even on a resource-constrained system. 
        Output goes into a user-specified directory.
