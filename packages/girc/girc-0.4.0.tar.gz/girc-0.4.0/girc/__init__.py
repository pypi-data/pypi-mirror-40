"""girc is a modern IRC client library based on the asyncio framework.

This library is in alpha and is not yet stable. This means that it
may change at any time and it is not recommended to use this unless
you are willing to tolerate and report some bugs and inconsistent
behaviour.

This library is in development, so these features may be in various
levels of completion right now:

    * Incoming and outgoing events.
    * Info and state tracking.
    * Server-based IRC mapping for dicts, lists, and strings.
    * IRCv3 capability support.
    * Escaping and unescaping IRC formatting for ease-of-use (bold,
      colours, etc).

For more information please see these links:

    * Github Repo: https://github.com/DanielOaks/girc
    * Hosted Documentation: http://girc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
