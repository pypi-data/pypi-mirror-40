class Regex(object):
    """Class of a Regular Expression.

    Only supports single-char symbols in alphabet! Concatenations are
    represented with '-'. End symbol '#' will be added in EXPR, but will not
    be in ALPHABET. Binary syntax tree will be generated and position numbers
    will be marked.

    Notice that '~' is regarded as epsilon here, and will not get a position
    number during the marking process. That also means we cannot use `~` as a
    normal char symbol like 'a' / '0' in the input alphabet.

    Attributes:
        expr     - str , RE expression with concatenations as '-'
        tree     - Node, binary syntax tree of RE
        alphabet - list, alphabet in sorted order
        index    - dict, table recording pos number-symbol pairs
