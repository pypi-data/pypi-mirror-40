        A unofficial CLI tool which uses the Quandl API and the Sharadar Essential Fundamentals
        Database to extract financial fundamentals, Sharadar provided ratios as
        well as calculate additional ratios. Results are
        written to an Excel Workbook with a separate worksheet per ticker analysed.

        Features
        --------
        
        For a given ticker, fundamental data is obtained using the Quandl API and the
        Sharadar Fundamentals database. This data is then used to calculate various
        useful, financial ratios. The ratios  include 
        
        - Profitability indicators
        - Financial leverage indicators
        - Free and Operating Cash flow indicators.
        
        Some REIT specific ratios such as FFO are very roughly approximated.
        These specific ratios are only roughly approximated since certain data, namely
        Real estate sales data for the period does not appear to be available via the
        API (It's often buried in the footnotes of these companies filings).
        
        
        The output excel worksheet for each ticker processed is divided into three main areas:
        
        - Sharadar statement indicators. This is data obtained from the three main
          financial statements; the Income Statement, the Balance Sheet and the Cash Flow
          Statement. 
        
        - Sharadar Metrics and Ratio Indicators. These are quandl provided financial ratios.
        
        - Calculated Metrics and Ratios. These are calculated by the package from the
          Sharadars data provided and tabulated by the statement indicators and the
          'Metrics and Ratio' indicators.
        
        The python Quandl API provides the ability to return data within python pandas
        dataframes. This makes calculating various ratios as simple as dividing two
        variables by each other.
        
        The calculations support the data offered by the free sample 
        database (formerly referred to by Sharadar as the SF0 database), and the paid for `SF1
        <https://www.quandl.com/data/SF1-Core-US-Fundamentals-Data/documentation/dimensions>`_
        database. The coverage universe is the same for both the sample data and the
        paid database. The key diference being, support as well as a much richer set
        of so-called Dimensions.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install quandl_fund_xlsx
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        If you have have a key for the free sample data set the  QUANDL_API_SF0_KEY
        environment variable. If you have paid access to the full range of
        fundamentals data set the QUANDL_API_SF1_KEY in the environment.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           export QUANDL_API_SF0_KEY='YourQuandlAPIKey'
           
           or
        
           export QUANDL_API_SF1_KEY='YourQuandlAPIKey'

        Local Development
        -----------------
        
        It's recommended to setup a virtual environment and perform the installation
        within this. Use  pip to install the requirements but not the
        package.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
        
            # Run the CLI by running as a module
            python -m quandl_fund_xlsx.cli -t MSFT
        
            # Run the tests
            pytest
        
        If you wish to install the package locally within either a virtualenv or
        globally this can be done once again using pip.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install -e .
        
            # Now the CLI is installed within our environment and should be on the
            # path
            quandl_fund_xlsx -t MSFT

        =======
        History
        =======
        
        0.1.1 (2017-08-31)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
        
        0.1.2 (2017-08-31)
        ------------------
        * Change logging to INFO from DEBUG
        
        0.1.3 (2017-08-31)
        ------------------
        * Minor tweak to Return the correct version
        
        0.1.4 (2017-11-06)
        ------------------
        * Removed the --dimension CLI keyword. 
          Now uses Most Recent Year (MRY) for SF0 database
          and Most Recent Trailing 12 Months (MRT) for the SF1 database
        * Fix to avoid the Pandas future warning about decrementing
          df.rename_axis and using df.rename
        
        0.1.6 (2018-01-26)
        -------------------
        Now uses the get_table methods from the quandl_api. 
        
        0.1.7 (2018-05-10)
        -------------------
        * Fix bug where the dataframe returned from quandl qas not being sorted
        * Added EPS and EPS diluted.
        
        0.1.8 ( 2018-05-24)
        -------------------
        * Fix bug where the SF0 subscription data was not being returned.
        * With the discontinuation of the Sharadar Time series API at the end of March
          2018, the codes for the free fundamental subscription SF0 database changed.
          Subscribers to the SF0 data now use the SHARADAR/SF1 code in the get_table
          accesses.
        
        0.1.9 ( 2018-06-11)
        -------------------
        * Added back support for the --dimension CLI option.
        
        0.1.10 (2018-10-29)    
        -------------------
        * Added some  new Cash Flow related ratios and corrected the LTDEBT ratios
        * Changed the default to be the paid SF1 Database as this is the one I'm using
          and testing. Requires a separate free SF0 subscription to test SFO. All of
          the API calls whether the user has an SFI paid membership or SF0 use the
          SF1 codes.
        
        
        0.2.0 (2018-11-13)    
        -------------------
        * After learning that the sample data API now allows _all_ of the same
          indicators as those available using the paid SF! aPI key I was able to
          remove a lot of special case code for the Sample data KEY. 
          The paid KEY allows for many more dimensions to be queried.
        * The CLI now defaults back to using the sample data SF0 API key.
        * Added a number of Cash Flow from Operations  based metrics as well as some 
          Free Cash Flow based metrics.
        * Added a development test which uses the API and a sample data or SF0 API key 
          to extract ratios for AAPL.
        * Added Excess Cash Margin ratio.
        
        0.2.1 (2018-11-13)    
        -------------------
        * Minor security fix, requests version now >=2.20.0
        *  Minor documentation cleanup
        
        
        0.2.2 (2018-11-13)    
        -------------------
        * Add support for the MRQ and ARQ dimensions.
        * Correct error in calculating CAGR when the data was given in quarterly increments.
        * Correctly reference the Excel spreadsheet example figures in the README.
        
        0.2.3 (2018-12-29)    
        -------------------
        * Check for the presence of the QUANDL_API_SF0_KEY or the QUANDL_API_SF1_KEY 
          environment variable  depending on which database the user is requesting to use.
