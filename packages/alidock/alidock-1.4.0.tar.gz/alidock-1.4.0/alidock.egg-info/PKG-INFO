        =======
        
        
        Run your ALICE environment from a container. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/),
        then:
        
            bash <(curl -fsSL https://bit.ly/alidock-installer)
        
        You may need to close and reopen your terminal as advised. Run alidock now:
        
            alidock
        
        You are instantly dropped in a shell with a consistent ALICE environment from a Docker container.
        From there you can directly run, for example:
        
            aliBuild init O2@dev --defaults o2
            aliBuild build O2 --defaults o2
        
        and it will download the precompiled binaries for you.
        
        Your home directory in the container, called `/home/alidock`, is available from outside the
        container in `~/alidock`. This means you can use your favourite text editor or IDE from your laptop,
        no need to edit from inside the container.
