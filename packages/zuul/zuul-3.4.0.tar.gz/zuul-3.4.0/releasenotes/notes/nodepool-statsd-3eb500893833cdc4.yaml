    The `zuul.nodepool` statistics have been moved under
    `zuul.nodepool.requests` to allow sub-stats to work correctly.
    For example `zuul.nodepool.requested` has become
    `zuul.nodepool.requests.requested.total`.  The previously missing
    `label` and `size` counters are now available at
    `zuul.nodepool.requests.<state>.<size|label>`.  For more info see
    the monitoring documentation.
