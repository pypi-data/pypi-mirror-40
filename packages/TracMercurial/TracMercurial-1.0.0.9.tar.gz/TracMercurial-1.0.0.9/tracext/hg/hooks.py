Mercurial hook calling `trac-admin $ENV changeset added` for newly added
changesets

The Trac environments to be notified are configured in the `[trac]` section
of `hgrc`. The path to an environment is specified in the `env` key. More
environments can be specified by adding a suffix separated by a dot.

The path to the `trac-admin` executable can be specified in the `trac-admin`
key. A specific path can be set for each environment, by adding the same
suffix to the `trac-admin` key.

The maximum number of changesets to pass per call to `trac-admin` can be
configured with the `revs_per_call` key. The default is relatively low (80
on Windows, 500 on other systems) for maximum compatibility, and can be
increased if you often push thousands of changesets and the system supports
it.

If the `trac-admin` option is left empty, the hook opens the Trac environment
and calls the relevant Trac hook directly in the same process. This will only
work if Trac can be imported by the Python interpreter running Mercurial (e.g.
if both are installed globally). Note that this may result in increased memory
usage if Mercurial is executed as a long-running process (e.g. hgweb in WSGI
mode). In this last case, the option `cache_env` can be set to `true` to
cache the Trac environments across invocations, therefore avoiding the
environment setup time on each invocation.

If the Mercurial plugin is installed globally (i.e. not in one of Trac's
plugins directories), the hooks can be configured as follows:
{{{
[hooks]
commit = python:tracext.hg.hooks.add_changesets
changegroup = python:tracext.hg.hooks.add_changesets
}}}

Otherwise, place this file somewhere accessible, and configure the hooks as
follows:
{{{
[hooks]
commit = python:/path/to/hooks.py:add_changesets
changegroup = python:/path/to/hooks.py:add_changesets
}}}

A typical configuration for three environments looks like this:
{{{
[trac]
; For a single Trac environment
env = /path/to/env
trac-admin = /path/to/trac-admin

; Two more environments, with a specific trac-admin for the second
env.other = /path/to/other/env
env.third = /path/to/third/env
trac-admin.third = /path/to/third/trac-admin
}}}
