Description: MiniBuild build system
        ======================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        *MiniBuild* build system is a pure Python package aimed to build
        executables, static and shared libraries from C, C++ and ASM source
        files. Build process can be launched from any directory containing a
        ``minibuild.mk`` makefile. This file describes what type of binary is
        going to be built and its dependencies on other modules inside a
        directory tree of your project.
        
        Supported toolchains and platforms:
        -----------------------------------
        
        -  Windows (i686, x86_64):
        
           -  Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017
           -  MinGW
        
        -  Linux (i686, x86_64, arm-eabi, aarch64):
        
           -  GCC
           -  A range of gcc cross-toolchains generated by crosstool-ng:
              https://crosstool-ng.github.io
        
        -  MacOSX (x86_64):
        
           -  clang
        
        Assembly language support
        -------------------------
        
        By default ASM source files are supposed to be written in toolchain
        default assembly dialect (which is usually MASM or GAS depending on
        toolchain being used for build). However threre is case, when your ASM
        source files are written in NASM assembly language dialect. To prescribe
        this fact a corresponding option just has to be turned on in related
        makefile.
