Description: # Soupstars
        
        Soupstars makes it easy to build website parsers.
        
        ```
        from soupstars import HttpBaseRecipe, ingredient
        
        class FacebookRecipe(HttpBaseRecipe):
            @ingredient
            def title(self):
                return self.read().find('h2').text.strip()
        
        fb = FacebookRecipe("https://www.facebook.com")
        
        print(fb['title'])
        # Connect with friends and the world around you
        ```
        
        Install with pip.
        
        ```
        pip install soupstars
        ```
        
        There's a few prebuilt parsers, but they're not necessary maintained.
        
        ```
        >> from soupstars.recipes.nytimes import NytimesArticleRecipe
        
        >> article_url = "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-address-border-visit.html"
        >> article = NytimesArticleRecipe(article_url)
        >> article.json()
        {
          "authors": "\"By Maggie Haberman, Michael M. Grynbaum and Eileen Sullivan\"",
          "published_at": "\"Jan. 7, 2019\"",
          "title": "\"Trump Wants to Deliver Prime-Time Address on Government Shutdown and Will Visit the Border\""
        }
        ```
