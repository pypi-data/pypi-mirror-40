Description: # ySanic
        ySanic is a [Sanic](https://sanicframework.org/) subclass with a bunch of utilities to help the developer to work with it in the context of the yRest framework (which includes [yModel](https://github.com/Garito/yModel) and [yAuth](https://github.com/Garito/yAuth) by the moment and yOpenSanic in the future)
        
        yBlueprint adds some decorators and route creators both for CRUD and tree models
        
        # Example
        In the tests folder there is an app with two models: Todos and Nodes
        Todos shows how to program the typical plain structure while Nodes shows how to program the tree ones
        If you respect the contract you could use the helpers (like the routes generators)
        
        ## Installation
