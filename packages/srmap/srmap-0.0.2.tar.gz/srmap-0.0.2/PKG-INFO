Description: # srmap
        Python library to edit SpeedRunners maps.
        
        Use `pip` to install:
        
            $ pip install srmap
            
        Below is some sample code to get you started. This will create a new level and save it to the file `map.sr`. You can also load existing levels, and modify the level however you like before saving it.
        
        ```py
        from srmap import level
        
        lvl = level.Level()
        lvl.save('map.sr')
        ```
        
        Once you have the level, you will need to replace another one in the `{STEAM}/userdata/{ID}/207140/remote/` directory with it, where `{STEAM}` is your Steam installation path, and `{ID}` is the Steam ID3 associated with the account you will be opening the game with. Then, simply start the game and you can play/edit/publish your level.
