## 1.1 Installation

`pywebcopy` is available on PyPi and is easily installable using `pip`

```Python
pip install pywebcopy
```

You are ready to go. Read the tutorials below to get started.

## First steps

You should always check if the pywebcopy is installed successfully.

```python
>>> import pywebcopy
>>> pywebcopy.__version___
5.x
```

Your version may be different, now you can continue the tutorial.

## 1.2 Basic Usages

To save any single page, just type in python console

```Python
from pywebcopy import save_webpage


save_webpage(
    url='http://example-site.com/index.html',
    project_folder='path/to/downloads'
)
```

To save full website (This could overload the target server, So, be careful)

```Python
from pywebcopy import save_website

save_website(
    url='http://example-site.com/index.html',
    project_folder='path/to/downloads',
)
```

### 1.2.1 Running Tests
Running tests is simple and doesn't require any external library. 
Just run this command from root directory of pywebcopy package


```shell
$ python -m unittest pywebcopy.tests
```

### 1.2.2 Webpage() object

```Python
from pywebcopy import WebPage

url = 'http://example-site.com/index.html' or None
project_loc = 'path/to/downloads/folder'

wp = WebPage(url,
project_folder
default_encoding=None,
HTML=None,
**configKwargs
)

# You can choose to load the page explicitly using 
# `requests` module
wp.get(url, **requestsKwargs)

# if you want assets only
wp.save_assets()

# if you want html only
wp.save_html()

# if you want complete webpage
wp.save_complete()
```

#### BeautifulSoup methods are supported

you can also use any beautiful_soup methods on it

```python
>>> links = wp.bs4.find_all('a')

['//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/', '/about/apps/', 'https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues', '/accounts/login/', '/download/other/']

```

### LXML is completely supported

You can use any lxml methods on it. Read more about lxml at `http://lxml.de/`

```python
>>> wp.lxml.xpath('//a', ..)
[<Element 'a'>,<Element 'a'>]

```

### PyQuery is Fully supported

You can use PyQuery methods on it .Read more about pyquery at `https://pythonhosted.org/pyquery/`

```python
>>> wp.pq.select(selector, ..)
...
```

### XPath is also supported

xpath is also natively supported which retures a :class: `requests_html.Element` See more at `https://html.python-requests.org`

```python

>>> wp.xpath('a')
[<Element 'a' class='btn' href='https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers'>]
```

### You can also select only elements containing certain text

```python
>>> wp.find('a', containing='kenneth')
[<Element 'a' href='http://kennethreitz.com/pages/open-projects.html'>, <Element 'a'
```

## Tutorials: sample use-cases with pywebcopy

## Common Settings and Errors

### `pywebcopy.exceptions.AccessError`

If you are getting `pywebcopy.exceptions.AccessError` Exception.
then check if website allows scraping of its content.

```python
>>> import pywebcopy
>>> pywebcopy.config['bypass_robots'] = True

# rest of your code follows..
```

### Overwrite existing files when copying

If you want to overwrite existing files in the directory then
use the over_write config key.

```python
>>> import pywebcopy
>>> pywebcopy.config['over_write'] = True

# rest of your code follows..
```

### Changing your project name

By default the pywebcopy creates a directory inside project_folder
with the url you have provided but you can change this using the code 
below

```python
>>> import pywebcopy
>>> pywebcopy.config['project_name'] = 'my_project'

# rest of your code follows..
```

## How to - Save Single Webpage

Particular webpage can be saved easily using the following methods.

Note: if you get `pywebcopy.exceptions.AccessError` when running any of these code then use the code provided on later sections.

### Method 1

Webpage can easily be saved using an inbuilt funtion called `.save_webpage()` which takes several
arguments also.

```python
>>> import pywebcopy
>>> pywebcopy.save_webpage(project_url='http://google.com', project_folder='c://Saved_Webpages/',)

# rest of your code follows..
```

### Method 2

This use case is slightly more powerful as it can provide every functionallity of the WebPage 
data class.

```python
>>> from pywebcopy import Webpage

>>> wp = WebPage('http://google.com', 'e://tests/', project_name='Google')
>>> wp.save_complete()

# This Webpage object contains every methods of the Webpage() class and thus
# can be reused for later usages.

```

### Method 2 using Plain HTML

> :New in version 4.x:

I told you earlier that Webpage object is powerful and can be manipulated in any ways.

One feature is that the raw html is now also accepted.

```python

>>> from pywebcopy import Webpage

>>> HTML = open('test.html').read()

>>> base_url = 'http://example.com' # used as a base for downloading imgs, css, js files.
>>> project_folder = '/saved_pages/'

>>> wp = WebPage(base_url, project_folder, HTML=HTML)
>>> wp.save_webpage()
```

## How to - Whole Websites

Use caution when copying websites as this can overload or damage the
servers of the site and rarely could be illegal, so check everything before
you proceed.

### Method 1 -

Using the inbuilt api `.save_website()` which takes several arguments.

```python
>>> import pywebcopy

>>> pywebcopy.save_website(project_url='http://localhost:8000', project_folder='e://tests/')
```

### Method 2 -

By creating a Crawler() object which provides several other functions as well.

```python
>>> import pywebcopy

>>> pywebcopy.config.setup_config(project_url='http://localhost:5000/', project_folder='e://tests/', project_name='LocalHost')

>>> crawler = pywebcopy.Crawler('http://localhost:5000/')
>>> crawler.crawl()
```

## 1.3 Configuration

`pywebcopy` is highly configurable.

### 1.3.1 Direct Call Method

To change any configuration, just pass it to the `init` call.

Example:

```Python
from pywebcopy.core import save_webpage

save_webpage(

    url='http://some-site.com/', # required
    download_loc='path/to/downloads/', # required

    # config keys are case-insensitive
    any_config_key='new_value',
    another_config_key='another_new_value',

    ...

    # add many as you want :)
)
```

### 1.3.2 `config.setup_config` Method

>**This function is changed from  `core.setup_config`**

You can manually configure every configuration by using a 
`config.setup_config` call.

```Python

import pywebcopy

url = 'http://example-site.com/index.html'
download_loc = 'path/to/downloads/'

pywebcopy.config.setup_config(url, download_loc)

# done!

>>> pywebcopy.config.config['url']
'http://example-site.com/index.html'

>>> pywebcopy.config.config['mirrors_dir']
'path/to/downloads'

>>> pywebcopy.config.config['project_name']
'example-site.com'


## You can also change any of these by just adding param to
## `setup_config` call

>>> pywebcopy.config.setup_config(url, 
        download_loc,project_name='Your-Project', ...)

## You can also change any config even after
## the `setup_config` call

pywebcopy.config.config['url'] = 'http://url-changed.com'
# rest of config remains unchanged

```

Done!

### 1.3.3 List of available `configurations`

below is the list of `config` keys with their `default` values :

```Python
# writes the trace output and log file content to console directly
'DEBUG': False  

# make zip archive of the downloaded content
'zip_project_folder': True

# delete the project folder after making zip archive of it
'delete_project_folder': False

# which parser to use when parsing pages
# for speed choose 'html.parser' (will crack some webpages)
# for exact webpage copy choose 'html5lib' (a little slow)
# or you can leave it to default 'lxml' (balanced)
'PARSER' : 'lxml'

# to download css file or not
'LOAD_CSS': True

# to download images or not
'LOAD_IMAGES': True

# to download js file or not
'LOAD_JAVASCRIPT': True


# to overwrite the existing files if found
'OVER_WRITE': False

# list of allowed file extensions
'ALLOWED_FILE_EXT': ['.html', '.css', '.json', '.js',
                     '.xml','.svg', '.gif', '.ico',
                      '.jpeg', '.jpg', '.png', '.ttf',
                      '.eot', '.otf', '.woff']

# log file path
'LOG_FILE': None

# name of the mirror project
'PROJECT_NAME': website-name.com

# define the base directory to store all copied sites data
'PROJECT_FOLDER': None


# DANGER ZONE
# CHANGE THESE ON YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
# NOTE: Do not change unless you know what you're doing

# requests headers to be shown on requests made to server
'http_headers': {
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
    'User-Agent': "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; PyWebcopyBot/{};) AppleWebKit/604.1.38 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/68.0.3325.162".format(VERSION)
}

# bypass the robots.txt restrictions
'BYPASS_ROBOTS' : False
```

told you there were plenty of `config` vars available!

## 1.5 Undocumented Features

I built many utils and classes in this project to ease
the tasks I was trying to do.

But,
these task are also suitable for general purpose use.

So,
if you want, you can help in generating suitable `documentation` for these undocumented ones, then you can always email me.
