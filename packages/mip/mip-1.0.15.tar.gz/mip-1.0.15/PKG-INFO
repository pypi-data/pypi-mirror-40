Description: # Python MIP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming) Tools
        
        Python MIP is a collection of Python tools for the modelling and solution
        of Mixed-Integer Linear programs (MIPs). MIP syntax was inspired by
        [Pulp](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) and the
        [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com) Python API. Porting Pulp and Gurobi models
        should be quite easy.
        
        Some of the main features of MIP are:
        
        * high level modelling: write your MIP models in Python as easily as in
          high level languages such as AMPL: with operator overloading you can
          easily write linear expressions in Python;
        
        * multi solver: works with different MIP solvers; right now Gurobi and CBC
          are supported;
          
        * fast: the Python MIP package calls directly the native dynamic loadable
          library of the installed solver; models are efficiently stored and
          optimized by the solver and MIP transparently handles all communication
          ;
        
        * cut generation: write your cut generator in python and integrate it into
          the Branch-and-Cut search;
        
        * solution pool: query the elite set of solutions found during the search.
