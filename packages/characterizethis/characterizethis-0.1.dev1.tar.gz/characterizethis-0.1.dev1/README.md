# characerizeTHIS

Tools to find out what we should characterize!

### Assumptions

* Assume all planets have atmospheres (this is likely true for most planets)
* Assume no planets have clouds or hazes (this is unlikely)
* Assume a circular orbit (this is largely true)
* Assume HST WFC3 for followup instrument (this is reasonable)
* Assume 1 second exposure time with a scan rate of 0.15s (this could be improved for each target)
* Assume HST WFC3 has no saturation limit. (This could be acheived with scanning)
* Assume one observation is taken (this is an underestimate)
* Assume 50 pixels of the detector are illuminated for the scan (this is reasonable)
* Assume 5 scale heights of atmsophere (this is an approximation)
* Assume atmosphere is purely hyrdogen (this is likely to be wrong for most small planets)
* Assume atmosphere is entirely opaque in the WFC3 bandpass (this is an overestimate)
* Assume starspot free (this is unlikely)
* Where masses are unknown, assume mass-radius relation from Weiss 2014 (this is an approximation)
* Assume 2MASS photometry is correct (this is reasonable)
* Assume planets have no reflection, all light us absorbed

All told, this will provide an overestimate of the signal or the 'best case' scenario.
