Description: # characerizeTHIS
        
        Tools to find out what we should characterize!
        
        ### Assumptions
        
        * Assume all planets have atmospheres (this is likely true for most planets)
        * Assume no planets have clouds or hazes (this is unlikely)
        * Assume a circular orbit (this is largely true)
        * Assume HST WFC3 for followup instrument (this is reasonable)
        * Assume 1 second exposure time with a scan rate of 0.15s (this could be improved for each target)
        * Assume HST WFC3 has no saturation limit. (This could be acheived with scanning)
        * Assume one observation is taken (this is an underestimate)
        * Assume 50 pixels of the detector are illuminated for the scan (this is reasonable)
        * Assume 5 scale heights of atmsophere (this is an approximation)
        * Assume atmosphere is purely hyrdogen (this is likely to be wrong for most small planets)
        * Assume atmosphere is entirely opaque in the WFC3 bandpass (this is an overestimate)
        * Assume starspot free (this is unlikely)
        * Where masses are unknown, assume mass-radius relation from Weiss 2014 (this is an approximation)
        * Assume 2MASS photometry is correct (this is reasonable)
        * Assume planets have no reflection, all light us absorbed
        
        All told, this will provide an overestimate of the signal or the 'best case' scenario.
