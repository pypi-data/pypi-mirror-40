# Python-Delayed-Assert

Delayed aka. Soft asserts for python

Few features:

    - No Dependenices on any other framework/library.
    - Should work with any testing framework.
    - Can be use as decorator or context manager.

## Installation

### Install via pip

```bash
    pip install delayed-assert
```

### Install from master

```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/pr4bh4sh/python-delayed-assert
```

## Uses

See `ExampleUnittest.py` for usage.

### Using assertion library with lambda

Pass the assertion call as

```python
    lambda: self.assertListEqual([4,5,6,2,5],[7,8])
```

While I've tested only with unittest asserttion,It should be able to use any assertion library.

Keep in mind that, Python does not support statement inside lambda, so

```python
    lambda: assert 1 == 1
```

won't work as it is not a valid lambda expression in python
