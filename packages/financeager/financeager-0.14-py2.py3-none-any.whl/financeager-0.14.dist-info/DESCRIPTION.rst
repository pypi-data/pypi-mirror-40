FINANCEAGER
===========

A command line application (possibly interacting with a Flask
webservice) that helps you administering your daily expenses and
earnings.

The ``financeager`` backend holds a database containing 'periods'. A
period consists of entries of a certain year.

Who is this for?
----------------

You might be someone who wants to organize finances with a simple
software because you're tired of Excel and the like. And you like the
command line. And Python.

NOTE
----

You're currently on the ``master`` branch which is under active
development.

Installation
------------

From PyPI package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip install financeager

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repo

::

    git clone https://github.com/pylipp/financeager
    cd financeager

Create a virtual environment

::

    python -m virtualenv --python=$(which python3) .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

Install

::

    pip install --upgrade --editable .

Alternatively, you can omit the second and third step and install
``financeager`` to ``~/.local`` with (requires ``pip3``)

::

    pip3 install . --user

Testing
-------

You're invited to run the tests from the root directory:

::

    git clone https://github.com/pylipp/financeager
    cd financeager
    make test

Usage
-----

Client-server or serverless mode?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run ``financeager`` as a client-server or a serverless
application (default). This can be controlled by a configuration file
(default path is ``~/.config/financeager/config``, however you can
specify a custom path by passing it along with the ``-C``/``--config``
command line option).

In either mode, you can configure frontend options, that is the name of
the default category (assigned when omitting the category option when
e.g. adding an entry) and the date format (string that
``datetime.strptime`` understands; note the double percent).

Default config:

::

    [FRONTEND]
    default_category = unspecified
    date_format = %%m-%%d

To run ``financeager`` as client-server application, specify a
server-sided configuration like this

::

    [SERVICE]
    name = flask

    [SERVICE:FLASK]
    host = 0.0.0.0

You can launch the server by running
``python examples/start_webservice.py`` (pass ``--help`` for more info)
or by wrapping the ``app = fflask.create_app()`` in a WSGI.

On the client side, you want to put something along the lines of

::

    [SERVICE]
    name = flask

    [SERVICE:FLASK]
    host = foo.pythonanywhere.com
    timeout = 10
    username = foouser
    password = S3cr3t

This specifies the timeout for HTTP requests and username/password for
basic auth, if required by the server.

Command line client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    usage: financeager [-h] {add,get,rm,update,copy,print,list} ...

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    subcommands:
      {add,get,rm,update,copy,print,list}
                            list of available subcommands
        add                 add an entry to the database
        get                 show information about single entry
        rm                  remove an entry from the database
        update              update one or more fields of an database entry
        copy                copy an entry from one period to another
        print               show the period database
        list                list all databases

On the client side, ``financeager`` provides the following commands to
interact with the database: ``add``, ``update``, ``rm``, ``get``,
``print``, ``list``, ``copy``.

*Add* earnings (no/positive sign) and expenses (negative sign) to the
database:

::

    > financeager add burgers -19.99 --category Restaurants
    > financeager add lottery 123.45 --date 03-14

Category and date can be optionally specified. They default to None and
the current day's date, resp. ``financeager`` will try to derive the
entry category from the database if not specified. If several matches
are found, the default category is used.

*Add recurrent* entries using the ``-t recurrent`` flag (``t`` for table
name) and specify the frequency (yearly, half-yearly, quarterly,
bi-monthly, monthly, weekly, daily) with the ``-f`` flag and optionally
start and end date with the ``-s`` and ``-e`` flags, resp.

::

    > financeager add rent -500 -t recurrent -f monthly -s 01-01 -c rent

If not specified, the start date defaults to the current date and the
end date to the last day of the database's year.

Did you make a mistake when adding a new entry? *Update* one or more
fields by calling the 'update' command with the entry's ID and the
respective corrected fields:

::

    > financeager update 1 --name "McKing Burgers" --value -18.59

*Remove* an entry by specifying its ID (visible in the output of the
``print`` command). This removes the ``burgers`` entry:

::

    > financeager rm 1

This would remove the recurrent rent entries (ID is also 1 because
standard and recurrent entries are stored in separate tables):

::

    > financeager rm 1 --table-name recurrent

Show a side-by-side *overview* of earnings and expenses (filter by
date/category/name/value by passing the ``--filters`` option, e.g.
``--filters category=food`` to show entries in the categories ``food``)

::

    > financeager print

                   Earnings               |                Expenses
    Name               Value    Date  ID  | Name               Value    Date  ID
    Unspecified          123.45           | Rent                1500.00
      Lottery            123.45 03-14   2 |   Rent January       500.00 01-01   1
                                          |   Rent February      500.00 02-01   1
                                          |   Rent March         500.00 03-01   1
    =============================================================================
    Total                123.45           | Total               1500.00

The aforementioned ``financeager`` commands operate on the default
database (named by the current year, e.g. 2017) unless another period is
specified by the ``--period`` flag.

::

    > financeager add xmas-gifts -42 --date 12-23 --period 2016

*Copy* an entry from one database to another by specifying entry ID and
source/destination period:

::

    > financeager copy 1 --source 2017 --destination 2018

Detailed information is available from

::

    > financeager --help
    > financeager <subcommand> --help

More Goodies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``financeager`` will store requests if the server is not reachable
   (the timeout is configurable). The offline backup is restored the
   next time a connection is established. This feature is only available
   when running financeager with flask.

Expansion
~~~~~~~~~

Want to use a different database? Should be straightforward by deriving
from ``Period`` and implementing the ``_entry()`` methods. Modify the
``Server`` class accordingly to use the new period type.

``financeager`` features
------------------------

Future features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  [ ] experiment with urwid for building TUI or remi for HTML-based GUI
-  [ ] support querying of standard/recurrent table with ``print``
-  [ ] return element data as response to add/copy/update request
-  [ ] support passing multiple elements IDs to update/rm/copy/get
   (maybe together with asynchronous HTTP requests)
-  [ ] extended period names (something along ``2018-personal``)
-  [ ] support ``print`` at date other than today

Implemented features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  [x] recurrent entries
-  [x] stacked layout for ``print``
-  [x] detect category from entry name (category cache)
-  [x] allow filtering of specific date, name, etc. for ``print``
-  [x] use flask for REST API
-  [x] always show entry ID when ``print``\ ing
-  [x] specify date format as ``MM-DD``
-  [x] validate user input prior to inserting to database
-  [x] support ``get`` command
-  [x] support 'updating' of entries
-  [x] sort ``print`` output acc. to entry name/value/date/category
-  [x] refactor config module (custom method to intuitively retrieve
   config parameters)
-  [x] ``copy`` command to transfer recurrent entries between period
   databases
-  [x] support specifying custom flask host/config with all cli commands

Discarded feature ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  select from multiple options if possible (e.g. when searching or
   deleting an entry): breaks the concept of having a single
   request-response action. Instead, the user is expected to know which
   element he wants to delete (by using the element ID) and can give a
   precise command

Developer's TODOs
-----------------

-  [x] refactor TinyDbPeriod (return Model strings)
-  [x] improve documentation (period module)
-  [x] create Python package
-  [x] set up Travis CI
-  [x] drop PyQt dependency for schematics package
-  [x] allow remove elements by ID only
-  [x] specify CL option to differ between removing standard and
   recurrent element
-  [x] refactor ``entries`` module (no dependency on schematics package)
-  [x] consistent naming (recurrent instead of repetitive)
-  [x] increase code coverage
-  [x] refactor period module (no use of CONFIG\_DIR)
-  [x] refactor some modules (e.g. split fflask and server)
-  [ ] use marshmallow package for keyword validation in period and
   webservice
-  [ ] use logging module instead of print

Roadmap for release of version 1.0
----------------------------------

This requires some restructuring of the software architecture.
Motivation and goals are outlined below.

Status quo
~~~~~~~~~~

-  module functionalities and responsibilities particularly overlap
-  also apparent in test code: no clear distinction between integration
   and unit tests

Goals
~~~~~

-  three separated top modules: core, backend, client
-  responsibilities:

   1. core:

      -  constants
      -  configuration (maybe move to client)
      -  exceptions

   2. backend:

      -  interfaces (localserver, fflask)
      -  REST API (resources)
      -  database management (server, period)

   3. client

      -  CLI
      -  communication pre-/post-processing
      -  HTTP requests
      -  response formatting (entries, model)

-  consistent, modular test structure
-  pave way for terminal user interface

TODOs
~~~~~

-  [x] remove TinyDB usage from model and entries
-  [ ] remove entries import from period
-  consider validation at CL interface
-  consider more fine-grained error-handling in period (distinguish
   between errors during validation and about non-existing elements)
-  [ ] integration test of cli module
-  [ ] move data dir to ~/.local/share/financeager
-  [ ] format and lint code

PERSONAL NOTE
-------------

This is a 'sandbox' project of mine. I'm exploring and experimenting
with databases, data models, server applications (``Pyro4`` and
``flask``), frontends (command line, Qt-based GUI), software
architecture and general Python development.

Feel free to browse the project and give feedback (comments, issues,
pull requests).
