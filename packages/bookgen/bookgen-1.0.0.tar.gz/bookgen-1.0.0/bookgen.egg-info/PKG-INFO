Description: # bookgen
        
        A python library using nltk to analyse two books and generate a new one.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install bookgen`
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```py
        from bookgen import BookGen
        
        book = BookGen("word_base_book.txt", "sentence_base_book.txt")
        # book.download() will download the nltk extras required, only needed once
        
        print(book.run())
        ```
        
        ## Explanation
        
        BookGen will parse word classes from the first specified book, looking like this:
        
        `{"NOUN": ["Mountain", "Valley"], "VERB": ["take", "went"]}`
        
        These are sorted by the nltk universal tagset.
        
        The second book serves as sentence base. It will be parsed into a list of word types that represent the whole book.
        
        `["NOUN", "VERB", "PREP", "NOUN", "CONJ", "VERB", "."]`
        
        Then, it generates a list of words from the words of the first book based on the second book.
        
        `["Nathan", "went", "to", "Valley", "and", "peed", "."]`
        
        This is joined with some capitalization fixes and returned.
