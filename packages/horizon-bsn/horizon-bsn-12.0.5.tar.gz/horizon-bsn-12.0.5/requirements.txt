# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# This library shares all of the same requirements as Horizon
# and doesn't work without Horizon so we depend on Horizon to
# setup the requirements. If any packages are added that are
# specific to horizon-bsn lib, put them here.
