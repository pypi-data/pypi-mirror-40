Connections Panel - UI designed for Big Switch Networks using html, javascript, python and django.

To run the Network Template's apply network template functionality, 
you must first install PyYAML-3.11. This was the parser used to get 
the data from the sample heat template given. A copy of the 
installation package has been included with this panel. Make sure 
to look over the README in the installation folder for the parser.

After the PyYAML installation, everything should work out of the box.
