Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Provides functions to read objects from Cloud Object Storage as a stream
        and submit tuples to create objects in Cloud Object Storage (COS).
        
        `IBM Cloud Object Storage <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage>`_ makes it possible to store practically limitless amounts of data, simply and cost effectively. It is commonly used for data archiving and backup, web and mobile applications, and as scalable, persistent storage for analytics.
        
        Sample
        ======
        
        A simple hello world example of a Streams application writing string messages to
        an object. Scan for created object on COS and read the content::
        
            from streamsx.topology.topology import *
            from streamsx.topology.schema import CommonSchema
            from streamsx.topology.context import submit
            import streamsx.objectstorage as cos
        
            topo = Topology('ObjectStorageHelloWorld')
        
            to_cos = topo.source(['Hello', 'World!'])
            to_cos = to_cos.as_string()
        
            bucket = 'streams-py-sample'
            # Write a stream to COS
            cos.write(to_cos, bucket=bucket, object='/sample/hw%OBJECTNUM.txt')
        
            scanned = cos.scan(topo, bucket=bucket, directory='/sample')
            
            # read text file line by line
            r = cos.read(scanned, bucket=bucket)
            
            # print each line (tuple)
            r.print()
        
            submit('STREAMING_ANALYTICS_SERVICE', topo)
