Description: # redo - a recursive build system
        
        Smaller, easier, more powerful, and more reliable than `make`.
        
        This is an implementation of [Daniel J. Bernstein's redo
        build system](http://cr.yp.to/redo.html).  He never released his
        version, so other people have implemented different variants based on his
        published specification.
        
        This version, sometimes called apenwarr/redo, is probably the most advanced
        one, including parallel builds, improved logging, extensive automated tests,
        and helpful debugging features.
        
        To build and test redo, run `./do -j10 test`.  To install it, run
        `DESTDIR=/tmp/testinstall PREFIX=/usr/local ./do -j10 install`.
